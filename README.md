# Personal Website

Welcome to the source code for my personal website, built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). 
You can view the published version [here](https://idanariav.github.io/personal-website-docusaurus/)

This site serves as a hub for my professional profile, knowledge vault, and newsletter content.

Docusaurus is a simple tool for converting your markdown notes into a high quality website.

For using Docusaurus, I recommend going over the documention, or watching this video:

After years of writing, refining and sharpening my Obsidian vault, I wanted a place to display my vast vault of interconnect ideas. Having done the research, Docusaurus was the answer.

At first I had three separate sites, one for my notes, another for the newsletter, and one for my professional profile. I couldn't be happier finding a tool that combined them all into one.

## Features

A few things that I created using Docusaurus:
1. Landing page - a fully customaisable landing page including photos and links
2. Knowledge vault - a collection of all my notes, including non fiction book summaries and high level "maps of content" pages
3. Blog - A feed-like blog pages showing recent articles, or sorted by date or tags
4. Site optimization - added plugins/features such as sitemap, google analytics, SEO optimization
5. custom scripts - I created the following scripts to convert my Obsidian vault into Docusaurus format:
    A. rename-files.js
    B. process-blogs.js
    C. process-markdown-files.js
