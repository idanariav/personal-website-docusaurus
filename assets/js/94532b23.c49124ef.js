She has already argued that each person\u2019s freedom depends on everyone else\u2019s, but here she explores the implications of that argument. In the first subsection she argues that \u201CThe Aesthetic Attitude,\u201D or the abstracted, distant perspective often taken by critics and philosophers, is intellectuals\u2019 way of evading their own status as concrete, individual, free human beings. In the second subsection, she looks at "Freedom and Liberation," and specifically what the continuous, incremental fight for the freedom of the oppressed looks like from an existentialist perspective. Many are in positions so dire that the only way they can promote their freedom is by a purely negative revolt against the forces that are oppressing them. Oppressors often fear and criminalize this kind of response, but there is no question that the freedom of the oppressed to pursue their goals without being coerced into a way of life they have not chosen is a meaningful freedom, while the oppressor\u2019s freedom to deny others their freedom is no freedom at all (because it undermines others\u2019 freedom, and anyone\u2019s genuine freedom depends on everyone else\u2019s). Oppressors often try to distract people from the value of freedom by creating and elevating other values, like a culture\u2019s distinctive past or the productive potential of capitalism. But tradition and capitalism only matter insofar as they promote freedom, which again proves that freedom is the most fundamental end of human action.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"In the third section of her final part, de Beauvoir asks how the oppressed should act for the sake of their freedom. She concludes that it is sometimes necessary to perpetuate injustice in order to fight injustice. This includes committing violence against people who have contributed to oppression out of obligation or ignorance (those who are responsible but not guilty for ignorance), or having to choose one liberation struggle instead of another when two conflict; it can even mean sacrificing one\u2019s comrades or oneself. In order to successfully revolt against tyrants who deny people\u2019s freedom and reduce them to their facticity, people have to use those same tools and reduce both their enemies and themselves to facticity. Both tyrants and revolutionaries promise their followers that their sacrifices are for the sake of a better, freer future, but this is the same mistake that philosophers make when they see ethics as an absolute rather than a respect for freedom embedded in every action. By reducing the individual\u2019s value to zero, tyrants and revolutionaries undermine their own project, turning society\u2019s value to zero, too (since the sum of zero is zero). Tyrants and revolutionaries have to turn their enemies, and also their followers to pure facticity, to objects and tools to be used for their grand goal.\nThis is why de Beauvoir favors democracy, which prioritizes \u201Cthe dignity of each man\u201D and refuses to sacrifice any for an imagined future fulfillment that will never truly come about (since people\u2019s struggle for freedom has no end). The real ethical problem, however, comes up when one must choose between two people\u2019s competing freedoms; one must decide based on which in turn opens more freedom in the future, which is the same reason that unjust revolution is better than unjust tyranny."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Now that she has shown that the question of whose freedom to prioritize relies on thinking about the future, de Beauvoir turns in the fourth section to the concept of the future, which she argues is split: people both imagine the future as a continuation of the present and hope for a utopian, perfect future, one with no connection to the present, in which \u201CGlory, Happiness, or Justice\u201D magically descends upon the earth. This latter concept of the future is precisely what can convince people to sacrifice the present, but it is based on a false hope for perfection, when in reality all human striving is limited, and ambiguity is a constant feature of existence. Politicians take advantage of people\u2019s wishful thinking and weakness for ideals, promising them a perfect future in order to turn them into instruments; this is how Europe justified colonialism, for instance. Instead, de Beauvoir insists, people should celebrate their existence, their finite projects and finite wills, rather than letting themselves be seduced by the promise of infinity."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"In the last section, de Beauvoir returns to the question of ambiguity and investigates in further depth what ethical decision-making requires. She determines that such decisions must aim at the freedom of \u201Cthe individual as such\u201D and accept violence only when it \u201Copens concrete possibilities to the freedom which I am trying to save.\u201D She offers French politics as an example: the people who consider themselves \u201Cenlightened elites\u201D pretend to govern on behalf of France\u2019s colonial subjects, but actually use their gestures to the colonized people\u2019s well-being as a front to continue oppressing and exploiting them. Instead of trying to \u201Ccivilize\u201D non-Europeans, she thinks, the only ethical stance is to act for the sake of people\u2019s freedom itself. She then looks at the Soviet Union, which has too easily used the goals of its revolution as an excuse to oppress people, even though it is theoretically possible that oppression would sometimes be ethical in order to help push forward people\u2019s liberation. Pursuing this difficult decision\u2014to use violence and oppression to fight violence and oppression\u2014means taking on an enormous responsibility and being extremely vigilant, detailed, and reflective. Needless to say, most politicians and revolutionaries fall short of this standard, which is why they, too, need critics: insofar as they respect freedom, they must embrace free resistance to their own ways."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"In a brief conclusion, de Beauvoir offers some big-picture remarks about existentialist ethics\u2019 relationship to her critics and other ethical systems. While existentialism focuses on the individual, since it is the individual who makes free decisions and pursues their own projects, she insists that existentialism is not solipsistic because it sees other people\u2019s freedom as necessary for any individual\u2019s. She asks whether the existentialist conception of subjective moral value is really meaningful, but reminds the reader that nothing is meaningful outside of subjective human perspectives, and that it simply does not make sense to hold human morality to the standard of objective truth, which no individual human could ever access. By centering morality on concrete action and people\u2019s finite projects, de Beauvoir concludes, existentialists affirm individuals\u2019 potential to make concrete contributions to the world and embrace their own freedom; if everyone did this, people could finally stop dreaming about a completely free utopia, because they would have it."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.admonition,{title:"Quotes",type:"note",children:(0,o.jsxs)(i.ul,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsxs)(i.li,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.h4,{id:"2-freedom-and-liberation",children:"2.
