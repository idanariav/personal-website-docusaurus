For example, religion can make one person better off, while the other does not. In that case, it is true to one person and not the other. However, while there are some edge cases, generally pragmatism is not relativist. The more scientific concept of truth often overlaps with the pragmatist concept of truth because in order for something to "work" for us, it usually requires it to be real. For example, gravity is true because if we ignore it, the way we live, the buildings we build, will be very hard. To see gravity as true is useful, and it is useful because it is true/proven.
