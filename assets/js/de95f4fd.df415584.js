Instead of asking others to be more transparent, we default to making false assumptions. And you know what they say about those who assume...

We often lack Context, which usually requires remembering what has happened before and why (do you remember the previous chapter?).

For example, going to the gym without remembering how you felt afterward or the sense of satisfaction when you weigh yourself each weekend could easily make you lose interest in going again. Similarly, small incremental changes might be too minor to notice daily, but looking back over a month or a year can make them much more noticeable.

When we develop a habit of writing regularly, we are more likely to notice recurring behaviors over time. As imperfect humans, we might make the same mistake twice or even a third time. In such cases, writing can help us identify these patterns, provide a stable source of learning, and serve as a foundation for possible solutions. For example, if we jot down all the instances where we failed to stick to our routines, it might prompt us to think about why that is.
