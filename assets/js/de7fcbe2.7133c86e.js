Could that something be our identity? And if so, what happens when we try to change it? This post explores why lasting personal growth requires more than surface tweaks, and what it really takes to transform.\\n\\n![are_we_capable_of_change.webp](/posts/are_we_capable_of_change.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nChances are, there are aspects of yourself that you wish to change. Even if we love ourselves (as we should), we often desire to be a bit better - more loving, outgoing, productive, less lazy, or less prone to Distractions. We all have something we\'d like to improve, yet we often doubt whether real change is possible.\\n\\nHow can we truly become someone different from who we are? When we attempt to change, it sometimes feels like there\'s a force holding us back, an anchor that keeps us in place. Perhaps this anchor is our \\"true identity,\\" making any meaningful change seem like a distant dream. We may believe that while small changes are possible, the significant ones are out of reach. But is this really true?\\n\\nWe often imagine change as a simple matter of swapping out traits, habits, or thoughts, as if we were replacing components on a list. However, this is more like playing a game of Jenga - remove or change too much, and the whole structure risks collapsing.\\n\\nThis collapse is the harsh reality of change: it\u2019s not easy, but it is a fundamental part of the process. Changing something significant about ourselves inevitably involves altering our identity. Once we accept that meaningful change requires us to adopt a new identity, we must also come to terms with letting go of the old one.\\n\\nIn essence, we can change, but in doing so, we transform who we are. It\'s almost like saying the same person doesn\u2019t change; rather, they are replaced by a slightly different version of themselves. Over time, these small shifts accumulate, resulting in a drastically different personality. This may sound extreme, but think about how different you were as a child. How much of who you are today can be traced back to who you were then? Some core tendencies might remain, perhaps a similar sense of humor, but your thoughts, values, and preferences have likely evolved dramatically. While you share the same body (more or less), you are hardly the same person anymore, and that\'s a good thing.\\n\\n## The Potential for Radical Transformation\\n\\nWe need to reconcile two seemingly conflicting truths about our identity. On one hand, we feel a strong sense of continuity in \\"who we are.\\" As we grow older, certain core aspects like being an introvert, our political ideologies, or our automatic reactions to specific triggers seem fixed and unchanging. However, scientific evidence increasingly shows that change is indeed possible. Perhaps more surprisingly, our actions shape our identity as much as our identity shapes our actions.\\n\\nWho we are and what we do are deeply interconnected, influencing each other in a continuous feedback loop.\\n\\nThis process is known as Habituation, driven by our brain\'s preference for energy efficiency. Our brains work to simplify decision-making by turning complex, mentally taxing choices into automatic habits. This self-reinforcing loop causes us to repeat certain behaviors without conscious thought. For example, brushing your teeth in the morning, checking your phone multiple times a day, or craving popcorn at the movies are all habits formed through repetition. While this tendency can be limiting, it is also liberating. Whatever change you seek to make may be challenging initially, but it will become easier as new habits form.\\n\\nIf you start eating healthier, over time, you\'ll find yourself craving salads as you once craved junk food. Acting kindly towards others makes us more compassionate, and practicing gratitude makes us more optimistic. Aristotle\u2019s assertion that by practicing virtue we become virtuous has finally been validated after 2,000 years. Change is a matter of building momentum; it\u2019s difficult to start, but once it gets rolling, it becomes unstoppable. Just like pushing a boulder over a hill, the initial push requires the most effort.\\n\\nBy adulthood, we\'re no longer \\"tabula rasa,\\" or blank slates, easily shaped and influenced. We accumulate habits, both good and bad, which become deeply ingrained. Because these habits are easy to perform, replacing them becomes a real challenge. This is why changing ingrained habits is like developing muscles, it requires a strong, decisive effort.\\n\\nYou can\'t \\"gently\\" abandon old habits; it takes a firm commitment to break away from them. If you have even a little willpower, now is the time to use it.\\n\\nThat said, change isn\'t about relying on willpower alone. Since habits form from repeated decisions, the key is to create an Environment where the \\"old you\\" finds it hard to thrive, and the \\"new you\\" finds it easier to emerge. For example, if you want to eat healthier, remove unhealthy snacks from your house and stock up on nutritious options. Smart change is not about facing temptation but about eliminating it. If your phone distracts you, \\"dumb\\" it down; if you lack empathy, challenge yourself to say three kind things to someone each day.\\n\\nIt will be painful and difficult at first, but the essential takeaway is that change is possible. Studies show that people aged 20 to 80 reported significant personal change over the past decade but anticipated little change in the next. We mistakenly believe our current selves are our final versions, but nothing could be further from the truth. New experiences lead to new habits, which in turn lead to new identities.\\n\\nWith each action we take, we move closer to our ideal selves. Who we are now is just a starting point, and who we wish to become is the goal. Our focus should be on charting the path from here to there, deciding what\u2019s worth keeping and, more importantly, what\u2019s worth discarding, and doing so with all the courage and resilience we have.\\n\\nYou can drastically change who you are because you already have. You are not the same person you were at 5, 10, or 15 years old, so why should now be any different?\\n\\n## Challenges of Transformation\\n\\nHow do we know if a change is truly beneficial? How can we be sure our desire to change comes from a genuine aspiration to improve rather than from a misguided direction? And if change is so valuable and positive, why is it often so difficult? Perhaps our natural resistance to change is not a flaw, but a feature.\\n\\nNo matter your perspective on change, it is undoubtedly intimidating, especially when we recognize how drastic and even disruptive it can be. Changing our identity is like moving a plant to a new climate; if we don\'t make the process gentle, the plant might not survive.\\n\\nAt first glance, it may seem contradictory to discuss change as both drastic and gentle. The distinction lies in the difference between form vs essence. The method of change, the form, must be decisive and powerful enough to uproot old habits and replace them with new ones. Trying to gently transition while still holding onto the past will likely fail, much like keeping temptations readily available in a rehab clinic.\\n\\nTo make change stick, we must show determination, resilience, and unwavering connection to our motivation, acting as if any other life is neither possible nor desirable.\\n\\nHowever, the essence of change, what we aim to become, should be a manageable shift from who we are now. Radical transformations, like going from a couch potato to a gym enthusiast overnight, or from a quiet introvert to a social butterfly, are unrealistic. Too much change at once can overwhelm us, leading to a backlash against the idea of change altogether. Humans can only handle so much transformation at a time; pushing beyond that limit risks triggering resistance, pain, or fear that can halt progress. The key is to recognize a continuity between who we are now and who we wish to become. The future version of ourselves must feel familiar enough that we don\u2019t feel like we are losing our identity entirely.\\n\\nWhen the change is too drastic, uncertainty grows exponentially, and this threatens us at our core. Uncertainty about who we will become, whether we will still enjoy the same things, or what our lives will look like generates existential fear, similar to the fear of death, because it feels like the end of our current identity. We experience this dread during pivotal moments in life, such as finishing school, getting married, or becoming parents.\\n\\nBy focusing on small, manageable changes, we can reduce this fear. We allow a connection to form between who we are now and who we want to be. It becomes, \\"I\'m still me, but a little healthier,\\" or \\"still me, but a bit more outgoing.\\" This approach maintains continuity between our different selves, like a council of evolving identities.\\n\\nThe magic happens when we realize how a series of small, manageable steps can lead to significant transformations over time.\\n\\n## Embracing the Process of Self-Transformation\\n\\nIn the TV show *Fullmetal Alchemist*, magicians can create extraordinary things, such as turning water into wine, using three fundamental principles:\\n\\n1. The ability to destroy, tearing apart what they touch.\\n2. The ability to reconstruct, using available resources to create something new.\\n3. The energy and extra materials needed to fuel the conversion.\\n\\nEvery meaningful change follows these three steps. First, we need the power to deconstruct. This means clearing space for who we want to become by breaking down habits and mindsets that hold us back. Next, we must have the ability to reconstruct. It\u2019s not enough to simply eliminate the old; we need to fill that newly created space with something new and better. Without this, we risk falling back into old patterns or being overwhelmed by a sense of emptiness. Finally, we need the energy to fuel this transformation\u2014the willpower and desire to stop the cycle of current behaviors and bring forth a new identity.\\n\\nThis process of transformation is not a one-time act; it\u2019s a lifelong journey. As long as we are alive, we have the potential to perform incredible feats of personal growth. By embracing this cycle of creative destruction and reconstruction, we open ourselves to becoming so much more. No change or identity is beyond our reach, as long as we understand that it requires time, effort, and vision. Our identity is not a fixed point but a dot on a spectrum of possibilities\u2014each version of ourselves slightly different from the last, yet all connected by a shared vision and history.\\n\\n## Conclusion: The Journey of Radical Change\\n\\nChange is often seen as something beyond our control, whether dictated by fate, biology, or the environment. While these forces may shape us, they don\'t have to hold us back. The reach of our potential is often limited only by the strength of our will. Many of us worry more about these perceived boundaries than we do about actually challenging them. If we commit to change with time, effort, and focus, we can dramatically transform ourselves, enriching our identity with growth and depth. Change is a journey\u2014are you ready to take the first step?\\n\\nThe boundaries of our personal development are shaped by the limits of our will, mind, and body. Interestingly, the more we understand these limits, the more we can push them. As we embark on this journey of growth, every step we take\u2014especially when guided by thoughtful planning and deep reflection\u2014helps us redefine who we are, what we value, and what our purpose is. This continuous self-discovery leads us deeper into understanding and expanding our potential.\\n\\nChange is the only constant in life. Our experiences and circumstances constantly evolve, challenging our identity and pushing us to adapt. Resisting this natural flow can lead to feelings of stress, frustration, and even victimhood. Conversely, accepting that change is inevitable allows us to flow with it, not against it. embracing this truth is not only more realistic but also more liberating. It enables us to grow into a more resilient and adaptable version of ourselves.\\n\\nThe first step toward meaningful change is acknowledging that change is not only possible but unavoidable. Instead of ignoring, resisting, or fearing change, we should focus on asking ourselves how we can grow for the better. What actions can we take today to move closer to the person we want to become? By embracing this mindset, we realize that our limits are farther away than we once believed. Circumstances do not dictate destiny, and while change is hard, it is never impossible. By adopting a \\"yes and\\" attitude, we can better navigate the flow of life and actively choose the direction we want to follow.\\n\\nWhen we view change as a choice rather than a mere occurrence, it becomes a profound exercise of our freedom. This freedom is not only about deciding what to do but also about choosing who we want to be. Although challenging, this journey is one of the most empowering, authentic, and liberating paths we can take.\\n\\nSo, what journey are you planning to embark on? What changes have always been on your bucket list but felt out of reach? What steps will you take today and tomorrow? Let these questions inspire you to take action and embrace the possibility of transformation.\\n\\n# ## Further Reading\\nmaster of change (book)\\nHow to change (book)\\nSwitch (book)\\n\\n%%"},{"id":"love-and-change","metadata":{"permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/love-and-change","source":"@site/blog/self-love-and-change-insight.md","title":"Self Love and Change","description":"How can you truly change if change means rejecting who you are?","date":"2025-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Change","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/change","description":"Embracing change and adapting to new situations"},{"inline":false,"label":"Kindness","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/kindness","description":"Cultivating kindness in our lives"}],"readingTime":3.425,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20250425214552,"Created":"2025-04-25 21:45","Modified":"2025-04-25 21:45","Version":1,"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"To change ourselves, we have to first love ourselves","tags":["change","kindness"],"ContentStatus":"Published","aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"love-and-change","date":"2025-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Are We Capable of Change","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/are-we-capable-of-change"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Joy of Doing Nothing","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/happy-doing-nothing"}},"content":"**How can you truly change if change means rejecting who you are?**  \\nIt seems paradoxical: if self-love means accepting yourself, how can it also fuel transformation? But the truth is, change rooted in self-hatred leads to burnout and hopelessness, while change fueled by self-love becomes an act of nurturing growth, not denying who you are. This post explores why real transformation starts not with rejection, but with care.\\n\\n![self_love_and_change_post.webp](/posts/self_love_and_change_post.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThey say that you can\'t change without loving yourself first, but that seems paradoxical. \\n\\nChange by definition means out with the old and in with the new, it\'s a rejection of what exists to make room for the \\"better\\" version, so how could self-love even make sense? \\n\\nIf we love ourselves too much, won\'t we want to stay exactly as we are?\\n\\nFor years I thought that I needed to be ruthless towards myself, that by being my worst critic I would overcome the fear and laziness of change. \\n\\nLike a drill sergeant I will erase the parts of myself that I don\'t like, and work effortlessly to develop the good parts. I would break me down to build myself back up again. \\n\\nThe \\"pain\\" of being hard towards myself seemed like the price I have to pay, similar to physical workouts where \\"no pain no gain\\".\\n\\nIt took me a while to see how harmful that perception was.\\n\\nImagine yourself as a captain of a ship. The ship is not great, you\'ve seen better. The color fades in places, some parts are rusty, and it is far from the dream boat that could take you where you want to go.\\n\\nWhat would happen if you hate that ship for all that it\'s not? For all it\'s flaws and imperfections? Hate won\'t magically turn it into your dream boat, on the contrary, you would either harm it yourself, or simply neglect it. Without proper maintenance and care, the ship would worsen even faster.\\n\\nAlternatively, if you loved the ship despite it\'s flaws, you would take good care of it. You would replace the broken parts, paint it every once in a while, and even invest time and money into improving it. It might never become your dream boat, but it will be the best boat you can have.\\n\\nYes, the metaphor was a bit \\"on the nose\\", but you get the picture. You can\'t grow into something beautiful out of self-hatred. Hatred is a vicious mindset, if we hate who we are now we would find things to hate even if/when we become better people. \\n\\nEven if we could push ourselves hard enough until good habits are the default, we would be miserable, feeling like slaves to ourselves, never good enough, never deserving love or appreciation. \\n\\nBut can we even change with that mindset? When we hate ourselves, what\'s the point of getting better? Hatred and belittling go hand in hand. We probably believe deep inside that at best we can only do marginal changes, or hide our bad qualities but never get rid of them. \\n\\nIt is a self-fulfilling prophecy of steady unhappiness, like being Sisyphus driving that rock up a hill. \\n\\nLoving ourselves is not narcissism. It is believing in our potential. Becoming a better person requires work from the \\"lesser\\" version of ourselves. Doing that work isn\'t easy so if we managed to change, it is only because we already possessed the qualities needed to do so.  \\n\\nTo love ourselves means to be our own gardener, to enjoy seeing ourselves blossom. .\\n\\nTo love ourselves means to love all the different parts of ourselves, the good and the bad, and all the versions of ourselves, past and future.\\n\\nWhile it is never easy being human, to balance between doing and being \\"more\\", with the satisfaction of who we are and what we have now, I hope that you have time to stop and appreciate yourself.\\n\\nSelf compassion will lessen the paradox, by increasing the satisfaction from who you are, while also giving you the strength to become better. \\n\\n## Further Reading\\n\\nMaster of Change (book)\\nThe Happiness Advantage (book)\\n\\n%%"},{"id":"happy-doing-nothing","metadata":{"permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/happy-doing-nothing","source":"@site/blog/the-joy-of-doing-nothing-insight.md","title":"The Joy of Doing Nothing","description":"What if doing nothing is the most productive thing you can do?","date":"2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Stillness","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/stillness","description":"Finding peace and stillness in a busy world"},{"inline":false,"label":"Creativity","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/creativity","description":"Exploring and enhancing your creative abilities"},{"inline":false,"label":"Recharge","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/recharge","description":"Methods recharge and rejuvenate"}],"readingTime":3.07,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20250214100535,"Created":"2025-02-14 10:05","Modified":"2025-04-14 14:58","tags":["stillness","creativity","recharge"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"Why doing nothing is both so hard and yet so essential","ContentStatus":"Published","Version":1.01,"aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"happy-doing-nothing","date":"2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Self Love and Change","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/love-and-change"},"nextItem":{"title":"Morality is like Colors","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/morality-is-like-colors"}},"content":"**What if doing nothing is the most productive thing you can do?**  \\nIn a world where time always feels scarce, we squeeze every moment for output, often at the cost of our creativity and peace of mind.

Usually something is hard because it\'s exhausting, because it demands our full attention and energy. Doing nothing sounds like the opposite of that.\\n\\nBut even for just five minutes, all I could think of was what I could have done with that time. I could read, I could do chores, I could start an episode, or go to bed sooner.\\n\\nAs if five minutes were the \\"make or break\\" of my day, stopping the productivity train seemed wasteful and illogical.\\n\\nI (and probably most of you), have an urge to do something, to treat time as a resource that must be spend wisely, because how can we not? It\'s not like we\'re immortal, and it\'s not like life is too easy that we can just lay back and rest.\\n\\nEven when we are not productive, like doom scrolling or watching tv, we feel guilty, so we can\'t shake that urge or sense of obligation to utilize our time well.

However, we know that every color is just a different combination of a few \\"basic colors,\\" like red, green, and blue.\\n\\nMorality is quite similar in this sense. We observe a vast diversity of moral views, whether between societies or within them, there often seems to be a gap so wide that it\u2019s easy to think there is no common thread in morality at all - that it is entirely relative or perhaps even non-existent. Sure, different groups may agree on certain issues, but that often seems more like a strategic compromise than genuine moral alignment.\\n\\nHowever, I believe that there are \\"basic colors\\" of morality. abstract notions of virtues and values shared by all humans, just combined differently in each case. Similar to how every color can be represented by a combination of the same three primary colors, moral values can also be seen as combinations of foundational elements.\\n\\nKnowing how and why we are different won\'t cause us to magically agree with one another, but it would make understanding easier, and this is a good important step.\\n\\nHere, we will explore what these \\"basic moral colors\\" might look like, where they come from, and what we can do to bridge the gaps between us.\\n\\n## The Big Bang of Moral Views\\n\\nIt\'s almost redundant to say that we often don\'t agree with each other. Disagreement is simply everywhere, just turn on the news, attend a protest, or have dinner with your extended family. This divide seems deeply rooted, we don\'t just disagree about a specific political candidate or policy, it\u2019s the underlying values these things represent that seem so obvious to us. We often think, \\"How could they not see it?\\" or \\"If I just explain it to them, they will surely agree with me.\\"\\n\\nHowever, they usually don\u2019t. It feels like they see the world through a completely different lens. To us, it seems like a distorted one, to them, we are the blind ones. Wherever you look, there\'s a vast spectrum of beliefs. It\'s actually surprising that humanity has made it this far and that we have relatively \\"few\\" violent conflicts nowadays.\\n\\nWithout delving too much into the details, this explosion of diverse moral views began in the last few centuries after the decline of \\"super ideologies\\" that had dictated our way of life and thoughts, such as religion and nationalism. \\"God is dead and we have killed him\\", said Nietzsche, and the question that follows is, \\"What comes next?\\"\\n\\nWith the rise of Individualism, Post-Modernism, and identity politics, we now see a broader range of moral views, partly because they are no longer censored or silenced. People are free to express themselves, and some might feel a need to stand out by developing a slightly different variation of their environment\'s moral beliefs.\\n\\nAs a result, instead of a few ideologies that are imposed upon us (forcefully or subconsciously), we now have a vast spectrum of views on topics like gender, climate change, immigration, and economics.\\n\\nHowever, it isn\u2019t entirely random. This is precisely why we have managed to survive (so far) without a complete societal collapse. We can see correlations between certain views that group us into ideological camps, like liberals and conservatives. Yes, there are many differences within these groups just as there are between them, but they still share some similarities.\\n\\nI argue that these groups form because they are situated near each other on several moral scales, similar to a monochromatic spectrum where all possible outcomes are combinations of the same fundamental colors.\\n\\n## Our Shared Moral Scales\\n\\nWhat are these \\"moral colors\\"? Below are eight scales that represent my interpretation of moral disagreements. Of course, these could vary, you might see six, ten, or different variations of them. But as long as we can agree that some scales exist, we can begin moving in the right direction.\\n\\nIt\u2019s worth noting that a person doesn\u2019t have to occupy the same position on the scale for every topic. On some issues, they may lean toward one extreme, while on others, they may be closer to the opposite end. Also, it\'s unlikely to find someone purely on one end of a spectrum. Since these scales represent values that we all care about, some compromise is expected.\\n\\nAdditionally, these scales are relevant both at the individual and societal levels. As nations often reflect the image of their populations, it is no surprise that moral deliberation on the individual level applies to countries as well.\\n\\n1. **Sanctity vs. Exploration** - This scale reflects how fixed or flexible we consider our values.\\n   - *Sanctity*: Some values are held as sacred, unquestionable truths that must be preserved. Sanctity isn\'t necessarily religious; for example, those who advocate for animal rights may see their suffering as an unquestionable moral concern.\\n   - *Exploration*: Truth is both \\"out there\\" and continuously evolving. To align with it, we must keep exploring, questioning, and adapting our beliefs, holding few or no values as absolute in an ongoing effort to stay aligned with \\"humanity\'s evolving spirit.\\" For example, slavery turned from common practice to taboo because we adjusted our beliefs.\\n\\n2. **Equality vs. Merit** - This scale focuses on the issue of rights and entitlement.\\n   - *Equality*: Rights are inherent to every person by virtue of existence, without any other conditions or justifications. Being human, or a conscious being, is enough to have a moral worth, and these rights should be equal for everyone, regardless of any other criteria.\\n   - *Merit*: People should be judged by their merits, which may mean a different distribution of rights and resources. For instance, individuals might be entitled to the fruits of their labor and creativity, provided everyone has an equal opportunity to demonstrate their worth. It\'s not who we are, but what we do that determines our value.\\n\\n3. **Individuality vs. Community** - This scale addresses who is considered the \\"smallest\\" morally relevant unit and whose well-being is prioritized.\\n   - *Individuality*: The individual is the primary or sole source of value. They are the judge, jury, and executioner of their path to fulfilling their potential. Societal rights are only granted as long as they serve personal interests, and the ultimate goal of society is to make the individual as free as possible.\\n   - *Community*: The community is the main source of value. Humans, as social animals, are subcomponents of the community. Individual rights are granted by the community as long as they serve the greater good, and the ultimate goal is the welfare of the community itself.\\n\\n4. **Security vs. Connectivity** - How much risk are we willing to take for potential benefits?\\n   - *Security*: The primary goal of society is to maintain the safety of its members above all else, treating others with suspicion and building \\"walls\\" (both literal and metaphorical) to separate ourselves from them.\\n   - *Connectivity*: Strength and vulnerability are intertwined and gained by being connected to others. This perspective emphasizes forming complex networks of dependence and cooperation.\\n\\n5. **Destiny vs. Cultivation** - This scale deals with the extent of control we have over our abilities and lives.\\n   - *Destiny*: Many aspects of life are beyond our control, even our beliefs, skills and thoughts are mainly predetermined either from birth or culture. We should acknowledge that and learn to work within our boundaries, to not \\"fight our nature\\", so that we could avoid disappointment, frustration and failure.\\n   - *Cultivation*: Our true potential is not only unknown but also within our power to shape and increase. We are the makers of ourselves, of our identity and our destiny.\\n\\n1. **Permissiveness vs. Dedication** - what is the importance of values and living virtuously?\\n   - *Permissiveness*: Life is about being in the moment and seeking experiences that bring joy and happiness to oneself and perhaps others. We forgive our weaknesses, understanding that to be human is more than living a perfectly virtuous life. It is not just impossible, it\'s highly depressing.\\n   - *Dedication*: We either find or create our purpose in life, a calling that drives us and demands our time, effort, and thought - even at the expense of personal happiness. Abandoning this mission would mean failing ourselves and what we stand for.\\n\\n7. **Redemption vs. Retribution** - How should we respond to those who harm us?\\n   - *Redemption*: \\"Evil\\" may not exist or often stems from ignorance, negligence, circumstances, or miscommunication. In these cases, it\'s not a moral problem, but rather a technical problem that can be solved. Improving the system, like education and welfare can reduce \\"evil\\", and most conflicts can be settled through discussion.\\n   - *Retribution*: True and lasting peace is achieved only when \\"evil doers\\" are deterred by punishment. Evil must be confronted and eradicated, otherwise, unchecked selfish tendencies will lead to corruption, embezzlement, and reduced cooperation and trust.\\n\\n8. **Authority vs. Diversity** - Should there be a hierarchy governing interactions between people?\\n   - *Authority*: Stability and prosperity are achieved when all parts know their place and work together seamlessly, following rules and guidelines that provide clarity and deter deviations.\\n   - *Diversity*: Rules and guidelines are often at odds with the complexity of human experience. Strength and creativity come from a non-hierarchical structure built on a diverse network of voices that share ideas and collaborate without external supervision. The network self-regulates without a clear \\"ruler.\\"\\n## How to Bridge the Gap\\n\\nHopefully, regardless of your political views, you found yourself resonating, at least partially, with both sides of each scale described earlier.\\n\\nIf so, then we are already a step closer to bridging the gap between different viewpoints. Recognizing that both sides of a debate have worthy values means that it\'s all about prioritizing values, rather than claming that some values are \\"wrong\\". Once we understand that, we find more common ground with those on the \\"other side.\\" It\u2019s not that they believe in something entirely different or that they \\"don\u2019t see the truth\\"; rather, they assign different weights to the same values and choose to prioritize one over the other.\\n\\nThis is what it means to hold values in a world with limited time, resources, and capabilities. Consider the choice between helping the poor and improving healthcare. Ideally, we would do both and wish for everyone to be better off, but real life often forces us to make tough choices.\\n\\nIt\'s in these moments, when we must prioritize one value over another, that we truly actualize our values. It\u2019s not about blindly sticking to a value but rather assessing its relevance and importance in each decision and weighing it accordingly. The same value doesn\'t have to always take precedence. Sometimes equality matters more, and other times, merit does.\\n\\nUnderstanding this doesn\u2019t solve all the world\u2019s conflicts. Disagreements will continue to arise, but if we can at least stop demonizing the \\"other side,\\" we can come closer to understanding and compromising. After all, we aren\'t made of different things, just different combinations of the same foundational elements, and that\u2019s something we can work with.\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nWhat might seem like completely different worldviews are, at their core, simply different prioritizations of the same fundamental values. Each value is \\"paired\\" with another, creating a dynamic where, in this world of scarcity, we are often forced to compromise between them. However, regardless of where we find ourselves on these moral scales, we can recognize that those we disagree with also care about the same values we do, they just prioritize them differently.\\n\\nUnderstanding this shifts the perspective from seeing others as \\"demons\\" with opposing values to viewing them as neighbors with different value weights. While this realization won\'t solve all of our conflicts, it does bring us one step closer to finding common ground and engaging in meaningful deliberation rather than confrontation.\\n\\n## Further Reading\\nThe Righteous Mind (book)\\n\\n%%"},{"id":"enemies-into-allies","metadata":{"permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/enemies-into-allies","source":"@site/blog/from-enemies-to-allies-insight.md","title":"From Enemies to Allies","description":"What if the person on the other side isn\u2019t the problem at all?","date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Communication","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/communication","description":"Understanding and improving communication skills"},{"inline":true,"label":"cooperation","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/cooperation"},{"inline":false,"label":"Mindset","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/mindset","description":"Developing a positive mindset"}],"readingTime":3.95,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20250308181044,"Created":"2025-03-08 18:10","Modified":"2025-03-15 10:05","tags":["communication","cooperation","mindset"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"Viewing disagreements as a shared problem rather than blaming is key to solving them","ContentStatus":"Published","Version":1.01,"aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"enemies-into-allies","date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Morality is like Colors","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/morality-is-like-colors"},"nextItem":{"title":"Admitting Our Faults","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/Admitting-out-faults"}},"content":"**What if the person on the other side isn\u2019t the problem at all?**  \\nConflicts are inevitable, but how we handle them makes all the difference.

This post explores how shifting our mindset can turn confrontation into collaboration.\\n\\n![from_enemies_to_allies.webp](/posts/from_enemies_to_allies.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## How (not) to Handle a Conflict\\n\\nWe want our relationships to be smooth, pleasurable experiences.\\n\\nWe hope that each will reach a level of synergy and understanding that goes beyond words.\\n\\nYet, as with all relationships, conflicts will happen. Your boss is angry about missing a deadline, your kid doesn\'t listen to you (for the thousandth time), your friends say something hurtful, and your partner doesn\'t do their share of the chores.\\n\\nConflicts are unavoidable, the question is how to approach them.\\n\\nThe unfortunate default response is to be filled with anger, disappointment and resentment. We feel as if we \\"can\'t help it\\", as if it\'s our body\'s automated response. Through red colored glasses, we see the conflict through the \\"blame game\\" eyes.\\n\\nWe say things like \\"why did you do this to me?\\", \\"why do you always do x on purpose?\\", \\"how can you be so inconsiderate?\\".\\n\\nWhen we are on the yelled side, we get defensive, we shift the blame back to the other person, we rebel against their wishes, we yell, we quit, we hide, whatever\'s necessary to protect ourselves. After all, how can we accept being treated that way? Once the fight begins, it\'s no longer admitting to making a mistake, rather that we are a bad or stupid person (or both).\\n\\nThe blame game only ends in one way, the worst way. It turns disagreement into conflict, it escalates, it hurts, and it fails to solve the problem that caused it.\\n\\nWe need to handle conflicts better, or more correctly, not treat them as conflict in the first place.\\n\\n## From Conflict to Cooperation\\n\\nA disagreement becomes a conflict once we see the other person as the problem, instead of the problem as the problem. If our kids doesn\'t listen to us, it\'s because they are lazy, inconsiderate, or selfish.\\n\\nWe attach the problem to their identity, which means the only way the problem will be solved is if they change who they are.\\n\\nInstead, we should see the problem as the problem. What caused the event? Why is there a miscommunication? Perhaps they don\'t understand what you\'re asking, perhaps they want to do it yet fail because of distractions or forgetfulness, perhaps they were having a really bad day so your request should be the last thing on their mind.\\n\\nRemember that most likely, people are not \\"out to get you\\", they hardly do things intentionally to hurt you, even if it seems that way.\\n\\nWhen we shift the perspective from \\"they are the problem\\", to \\"there\'s a problem\\", a whole new range of options opens up that gives a much healthier view on the situation.\\n\\nWhen the other person is not the problem, you turn them from an enemy to an ally.\\n\\nAllies can use their collective intelligence, motivation and energy to solve a shared problem. Being enemies usually only make the problem worse. It\'s a huge difference when the \\"other side\\" works with you, not against you, offering solutions that you might not have thought about.\\n\\nFor example, a criticizing boss doesn\'t mean they are a disagreeable person, rather it\'s a shared communication problem. Having a sync at the start of a project instead of at the end will make sure the plan works for both sides, preventing the criticism in advance, without targeting someone as problematic\\n\\n## Actionable Tips: How to Turn Conflict Into Collaboration\\n- **Pause before reacting** \u2013 Take a breath before assuming the worst.\\n- **Describe the problem** \u2013 Instead of blaming, describe the problem objectively, as something you both face together.\\n- **Use \u201cI\u201d statements** \u2013 Say how the situation affects you rather than accusing. Like \\"I feel that...\\" instead of \\"you always...\\"\\n- **Seek their input** \u2013 Ask them how they view the situation, and which solutions they can offer.\\n- **Look for common ground** \u2013 Focus on shared interests, not differences.\\n## Ask Yourself\\n- How do I typically react to conflict?\\n- Have I ever assumed bad intent when there was none?\\n- How can I better separate the person from their behavior?\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nA disagreement is nothing more than a shared problem, one that we can work together to solve. Turning it into a blame game makes it a conflict, where both sides get hurts and the problem remains unsolved. Remember - the problem is the problem, not the person.\\n\\n%%"},{"id":"Admitting-out-faults","metadata":{"permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/Admitting-out-faults","source":"@site/blog/admitting-our-faults-insight.md","title":"Admitting Our Faults","description":"What if admitting you\'re wrong is the key to getting it right?","date":"2025-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Accountability","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/accountability","description":"Take responsibility for your actions and decisions"},{"inline":false,"label":"Challenges","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/challenges","description":"Overcoming obstacles and challenges in life"},{"inline":false,"label":"Change","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/change","description":"Embracing change and adapting to new situations"}],"readingTime":3.705,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20250208155454,"Created":"2025-02-08 15:54","Modified":"2025-02-14 11:02","tags":["accountability","challenges","change"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"Admitting our mistakes is the only way to learn from them","ContentStatus":"Published","Version":1.01,"aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"Admitting-out-faults","date":"2025-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"From Enemies to Allies","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/enemies-into-allies"},"nextItem":{"title":"Emotional Aikido - Turn Chaos into Momentum","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/chaos-into-momentum"}},"content":"**What if admitting you\'re wrong is the key to getting it right?**  \\nWe avoid facing our mistakes because it hurts, but denial only locks them in.

Sometimes it feels that admitting our mistakes is even worse than the mistake itself.\\n\\nPerhaps we have failed to notice that we made a mistake, or that we hope we can fix it before anyone else can see, but when we admit it we turn in into reality, it becomes common knowledge.\\n\\nAll of our faults, our imperfection and our \\"ugly sides\\" are now publicly displayed for everyone to see. It feels like an indication that we have failed as people, that not only our actions, but our identity is hurt, lacking, weak.\\n\\nI was (and somewhat still am) afraid of admitting I\'m wrong. Whenever I get criticized, I immediately go into defensive mode. I deny, I redirect, I rage, because I feel that to listen and agree is a proof of my low worth. Although, deep inside, I now that these reactions are strong precisely because the feedback is true, that I have failed, as if by denying it I can change reality.\\n\\n## The Hidden Cost of Denial\\n\\nWhile denying our mistakes makes us feel better on the short term, it\'s harmful in the long run.\\n\\nWe prioritize our Ego over our growth.\\n\\nIt means that instead of addressing these mistakes head on, we ignore them, which is a sure recipe of repeating them. It gets worse if on top of denying them we blame someone or something else, because this hurts not just our ability to deal with these specific mistakes, but also cultivates a mindset of helplessness, as if there was nothing you could have done differently, as if we are always right and perfect, and it is others who set us back.\\n\\nIronically, by ignoring our mistakes we turn them from momentary errors to a permanent stain on our identity. We hide them because we fear we are truly worthless, incompetent. We give them power over our lives, over our identity.\\n\\nRemoving their power is through taking ownership and accountability, by admitting them we show others that we are honest, that we can do better, that we wish to be better, that we don\'t let these moments define us, and that we take responsibility over our actions, our behavior, and not dismiss it or blame others when it\'s convenient.\\n\\nIdentifying with our mistakes is the best way to overcome them.\\n\\n## Actionable Tips: How to Embrace Your Mistakes\\n- **Pause & Reflect** \u2013 When faced with criticism, instead of reacting defensively, take a moment to listen. Recognize that they are trying to help you, that they criticize the action, not your identity.\\n- **Reframe Failure** \u2013 See mistakes as learning opportunities, not personal failures. Mistakes are valuable lessons, ones that we can learn only by examining them.\\n- **Ask for Feedback** \u2013 Don\'t run away from feedback, embrace it. Constant feedback has preventative qualities, providing insights that will reduce the number and the degree of our mistakes.\\n- **Be future oriented** \u2013 Analyze your mistakes in a forward looking way, focus on what you can do better next time.\\n\\n## The Takeaway: The Power of Owning Your Mistakes\\n\\nSaying \\"I was wrong\\" is a liberating experience. By taking ownership over our mistakes, we are able to overcome them. There is nothing to be ashamed of, it is a proof of character, rather than a stain on one, to admit that we were wrong.\\n\\nAs with failures in general, they are the stepping stones for our improvement, we try, we fail, we learn, to try to live without error is like trying to be the best painter in the world without ever holding a brush. Improving and failing are two sides of the same coin.\\n\\nSo be proud, that you had the courage to try, the courage to step out of your comfort zone, and the courage to own your mistakes.\\n\\n## Ask Yourself\\n- When was the last time I admitted I was wrong?\\n- How do I feel about myself when I make a mistake?\\n- How do I handle mistakes? Is there a learning process afterwards?\\n\\n%%"},{"id":"chaos-into-momentum","metadata":{"permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/chaos-into-momentum","source":"@site/blog/emotional-aikido---turn-chaos-into-momentum-synthesis.md","title":"Emotional Aikido - Turn Chaos into Momentum","description":"Do you ever feel like you\'re fighting with yourself?","date":"2025-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Motivation","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/motivation","description":"Finding and maintaining motivation in your life"},{"inline":false,"label":"Emotions","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/emotions","description":"Understanding and managing your emotions"}],"readingTime":10.105,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20230329173441,"Created":"2023-03-29 17:34","Modified":"2025-02-02 06:36","tags":["motivation","emotions"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"Live would be much easier, successful, and peaceful when we work with our emotions instead of against them","ContentStatus":"Published","Version":1.01,"aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"chaos-into-momentum","date":"2025-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Admitting Our Faults","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/Admitting-out-faults"},"nextItem":{"title":"Say Yes To Less","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/say-yes-to-less"}},"content":"**Do you ever feel like you\'re fighting with yourself?**  \\nThat inner conflict between your rational goals and emotional impulses might be holding you back more than you realize. In this post, we explore how bridging that internal divide can lead to clarity, energy, and real progress, without the burnout or guilt.\\n\\n![emotional_aikido_post.webp](/posts/emotional_aikido_post.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## Introduction\\n\\nWe have all faced struggles in our lives, especially internal ones. It\'s as if we are made up of two distinct selves: the \\"Rational \\" side that strives for action without excuses, and the \\"emotional\\" side that prefers the easier, more enjoyable path.\\n\\nWhile we strongly feel these two separates sides and how often they clash, by viewing ourselves this way we are setting ourselves up for failure. This false dichotomy often leads us to ruin, whether through apathy, self-hatred, or losing track of what matters most. When we leave ourselves divided, we fail to benefit from the energy and determination of a unified whole, like trying to use bikes without handles, or alternatively a bike with no wheels. We need both to prosper.\\n\\nToday we\'ll discuss how to do just that, and I hope you\'ve got your sweatshirts and headbands ready because I like to call this method *Emotional Aikido*. But first let\'s explain why each side is insufficient on its own, and how can we bring these two parts together.\\n\\n## Why Can\'t I just \\"power through\\"\\n*\\"Tomorrow I\'ll do better.\\"* Famous first, and often last, words of many commitments. Unfortunately, most end up repeating the same negative routines. It could be going to the gym, starting that healthy diet, or calling friends and family. More often than not, these promises go unfulfilled.\\n\\nIn modern times, perhaps since the great scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, we\'ve placed too much trust in our brains. We believe that \\"if there is a will, there is a way,\\" only to end up on the same path as before. What we need to understand is that Willpower is Limited, and relying solely on \\"powering through\\" to achieve our goals is not only ineffective or delusional but can also be harmful.\\n\\nWe tend to believe that willpower works like this:\\n1. **Motivation** - We start with motivation, perhaps sparked by a strong desire to change something in our lives.\\n2. **Action** - We begin to take action, aligning with our goals, and we feel as if it will be smooth sailing from now on.\\n3. **Change** - We start seeing changes resulting from these actions and embrace them wholeheartedly.\\n\\nHowever, this model is misleading, and our life experiences may have already shown us that it\'s not as simple as it seems.\\n\\nA more accurate representation of reality involves understanding that change is not always a guaranteed outcome when relying on rationality alone. Moreover, there are two infinite loops we can easily get trapped in if we aren\'t careful: the loops of apathy and Procrastination. I call them the \\"why even try\\" and \\"why not tomorrow\\" cycles. Once we enter these loops, they can be incredibly difficult to escape.\\n\\nTherefore, the first step is to understand what causes us to fall into these loops in the first place.\\n\\n### Why even Try?\\n\\nWe often end up discouraged after a failure, which is almost inevitable. Maybe you accidentally skip a workout, the healthy diet isn\'t showing results, or you\'ve had a rough day and just can\'t muster the strength to follow through. When these setbacks happen once or twice, we might be able to push through and reignite our motivation to start again. However, each failure can feel like a tiny puncture in a wheel; eventually, there\'s no air left to keep going. Instead of starting again, we simply give up. The world starts to look like a pessimistic and deterministic place, where failure seems predestined, so there\'s no point in even trying.\\n\\nEscaping this cycle is challenging because it requires us to \\"forget\\" the lessons we\'ve learned the hard way and take a leap and try again. Even when every fiber of our being tells us it\'s foolish to attempt something that can only lead to disappointment.\\n\\nWhether fueled by anger at the world, anger at ourselves, or both, falling into this pit of despair makes it incredibly difficult to climb back out.\\n\\n### Why not Tomorrow\\n\\nA second infinite cycle, perhaps more elusive than the first, is the cycle of procrastination, the \\"why not tomorrow\\" loop. After all, you can\'t fail if you never try. Unlike the first cycle, it\u2019s not that we lack motivation, we might even be genuinely optimistic about how our lives could improve when we will start to act differently. The problem is that \\"now is not the right time.\\"\\n\\nThe fear of Failure pushes us to set the bar so high for what we consider success that it becomes nearly unattainable. For example, what\'s the point of working out for just 20 minutes a week if a \\"good\\" workout must last at least 45 minutes? And since I don\'t have that much time right now, it\'s better not to do it at all. Or perhaps, we think that we are not yet worthy, for example who am I to write a blog post about productivity? I should read and study more until I\'m absolutely certain I\'m an expert on the topic. Until then, I won\u2019t write a single word!\\n\\nIf in the previous example, each failure was like a puncture in our tires, then here, we won\'t even start the car unless we have complete information about the road conditions, the state of the car, and are 100% certain we\u2019ll reach our destination.\\n\\n## Why Can\'t I just Do it when I Feel like it\\n\\nJust like with the rational side, there\u2019s also the emotional side. Whether due to personal tastes, beliefs, or disappointment with rational approaches, we may shift to a mindset that relies on our internal world of emotions and sensations as the source of our actions, rather than cold, rational decision-making.\\n\\nFor instance, we might believe that life is like a flowing river that shouldn\u2019t be controlled. Perhaps we realize that our disappointment with the rational approach stems from something within us resisting the change, so we decide to listen to our feelings, to our body, and do what feels right.\\n\\nThis might sound similar to the \\"why not tomorrow\\" case, but the difference is that in that scenario, the desire was for complete control and knowledge before taking action. Here, it\u2019s not about control but rather motivation. The driver isn\u2019t concerned with the car or the road, they are simply not sure if they want to drive at all. Unlike the \\"why even try\\" scenario, it\u2019s not that we believe it\u2019s doomed from the start, we might even think that if we truly wanted to, we could succeed, we\u2019re just not sure if we want to, or prefer to leave things to nature, fate or chance instead of being the driver ourselves.\\n\\nSo, what\u2019s wrong with this approach? Relying solely on internal feelings can lead to:\\n\\n4. **Inconsistency** - Even with habits that feel most natural to us, we don\u2019t always find the Intrinsic Motivation to stick with them. If we only act when we feel like it, our actions are likely to be inconsistent, which won\'t help us achieve our goals. For example, working out once a month is unlikely to yield the desired results.\\n5. **Imbalance** - On the other hand, we can sometimes get so caught up in what we\'re doing that we forget everything else. This sense of Flow is often a good thing, but without knowing when to stop, it can lead to extreme outcomes, such as becoming a workaholic or developing a \\"one-track mind.\\"\\n6. **Misalignment** - Not everything that feels good is necessarily good for us. Unfortunately, nearly everything, from food to mass media, has been engineered to affect us emotionally. If we use our biological tendencies as guides, we can sometimes be led astray by our emotions.\\n\\n## The Solution? Emotional Aikido\\n\\nThis is just one tool in our overarching plan to achieve balance. The main idea is simple: instead of fighting against yourself, work with yourself to achieve better results.\\n\\nBut why call it \\"emotional aikido\\"? Aikido is a Japanese martial art often translated as \\"the path of harmony,\\" where you act to preserve not only yourself but also your opponent, discouraging violence and aggression. The way to achieve this is by using your opponent\'s momentum against them.\\n\\nAn easy example: if an opponent is running at you, you can either stand your ground and fight, or step aside and trip them. In doing so, you use all their energy and momentum against them, turning their attack into their downfall.\\n\\nSo how does this apply to our topic? The answer is perhaps simple to understand yet harder to implement: as with most things, the answer lies in the middle. Yes, we need to listen to our body and emotions when we act. Trying to \\"push through\\" and force ourselves to do something we don\u2019t truly want is a waste of time. However, acting solely based on feelings lacks the structure, direction, and consistency provided by a rational approach.\\n\\nSo, how do we connect these two parts?\\n\\n7. **Know Thyself** - Regularly perform self-checks, asking yourself how you feel in the moment and noticing patterns that arise. For instance, maybe you avoid working out because you\'re ashamed of how you look, or your motivation for writing comes from a desire to support others and help them learn from your mistakes.\\n8. **Plan with the Heart in Mind** - Now that we know what makes us tick, we can find ways to motivate ourselves without relying on sheer willpower. Techniques like Temptation Bundling, priming your environment, and motivational scheduling are just a few examples. If we plan this way, we may slowly see ourselves beginning to enjoy doing what is good, and those hard actions suddenly become easier.\\n9. **Convert Failure to Fuel** - A common saying in Stoicism is that good or bad is a result of internal judgment, independent of external events. While this may not apply to every situation, we can certainly adopt this mindset regarding failure. By seeing failures as opportunities to learn and grow rather than as a mark of shame, we can completely shift our motivation. Failure means you\u2019re not there yet, not that you can\'t get there. Sometimes, failure contains the lessons needed to ensure we don\u2019t repeat it and achieve Mastery, provided we spend enough time listening to it. We are not defined by our failures, but by how we respond to them.\\n\\nIf instead of fighting ourselves, we listen,\\nif instead of making it hard, we make it easy,\\nif instead of getting angry, we get excited,\\nthen we have mastered emotional aikido.\\n\\nOur emotions, even the \\"bad ones\\" and perhaps especially the bad ones, such as jealously, envy, anger and frustration are the greatest source of fuel we have. Rather than being denied or ignored, they should be embraced. They are like a storm brewing with us, waiting for something to strike. It is the rational side\'s job to funnel that immense energy to a positive outlet, to ride that storm until we reach our destination. Fuel and direction, emotion and rationality, we need them both.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nWe\'ve explored two models of thinking-to-action: one based on rationality and the other on emotionality. Each, when used in isolation, has its pitfalls:\\n\\n- **Rationality without emotions** leads to burnout, self-hatred, and procrastination.\\n- **Emotions without rationality** result in inconsistency, misalignment, and imbalance.\\n\\nBut when combined, these two approaches create a powerful synergy that is greater than the sum of its parts. The rational side offers direction and structure, while the emotional side provides the fuel. By merging them, you can work smart, not hard. And as a bonus, this blend not only enhances productivity but also fosters balance and well-being in life. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Further Reading:\\nEgo Is The Enemy (book)\\nThe Obstacle Is the Way (book)\\nMindset (book)\\nFlow (book)\\n\\n%%"},{"id":"say-yes-to-less","metadata":{"permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/say-yes-to-less","source":"@site/blog/say-yes-to-less-insight.md","title":"Say Yes To Less","description":"Feeling overwhelmed and falling short on all fronts?","date":"2025-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Focus","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/focus","description":"Improving concentration and focus in your life"},{"inline":false,"label":"Minimalism","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/minimalism","description":"Simplifying your life and decluttering your mind"},{"inline":false,"label":"Reflection","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/reflection","description":"Reflect on your life, your decisions, and your future"}],"readingTime":3.125,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20241123082014,"Created":"2024-11-23 08:20","Modified":"2024-11-23 08:20","Version":1,"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"By narrowing our scope we can accomplish more","tags":["focus","minimalism","reflection"],"ContentStatus":"Published","aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"say-yes-to-less","date":"2025-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Emotional Aikido - Turn Chaos into Momentum","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/chaos-into-momentum"},"nextItem":{"title":"Dont Be a Black Box - Give Us a Hint","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/dont-be-a-black-box"}},"content":"**Feeling overwhelmed and falling short on all fronts?**  \\nWhen everything feels urgent, nothing truly moves forward. This post dives into why doing less strategically can help you do more of what really matters. Let go of guilt, cut the noise, and focus your energy where it counts.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Overwhelm and Overcommitment\\n\\nWhat are you planning to do after reading this? Perhaps you need to work, get groceries, handle some bureaucracy, help a friend, pursue personal goals, fix that thing that\u2019s been broken for weeks, or maybe even all of the above. Especially now when a new year has just started and promises of \\"new year new me\\" have been pilling up, it\u2019s no wonder we often feel overwhelmed, like there just aren\u2019t enough hours in the day. Even if the days were twice as long, it might still not feel like enough to clear our endless to-do lists.\\n\\nThe commitments we juggle - to ourselves, to friends, to our partners, and to the lifestyles we aspire to create - can easily become overwhelming. This constant pressure leaves us frustrated or, worse, guilty for failing to meet our own expectations and those of others. The feeling of not doing enough, of not being enough, becomes an ever-present shadow.\\n\\n### Do Less to Achieve More\\n\\nThe truth is simple and unavoidable: there will never be enough time. As long as we fail to set boundaries and say no, we\u2019ll remain trapped in the cycle of trying to do it all. And while doing it all might sound admirable, in reality, \u201call\u201d includes both the significant and the trivial. Our time is limited, we must learn to be selective.\\n\\nSaying no is about more than refusing requests - it\u2019s about choosing what to focus on. Saying yes to less allows us to devote our energy to what truly matters, making meaningful progress on priorities instead of getting stuck in the endless churn of busyness. By doing less, we can ultimately achieve more.\\n\\nSaying no is hard, especially to ourselves. Our dreams are endless and our time so limited, but this is precisely why we need to narrow down, to prioritize what we spend time on, and have the strength to say no to the trivial. When you know what\'s important to you and why, it\'s easier to say no to the rest. \\n\\n### Actionable Tips to Simplify and Prioritize\\n\\n1. **Audit your commitments:**\\n\\t1. Make a list of everything currently on your plate. Identify which commitments align with your core values and goals.\\n\\t2. Highlight tasks that can be postponed, delegated, or removed entirely.\\n2. **Set boundaries:**\\n\\t1. Practice saying \\"no\\" to new commitments that don\u2019t align with your priorities.\\n\\t2. Communicate openly with others about adjusting expectations to manage your workload realistically.\\n3. **Focus deeply:**\\n    1. Choose one or two high-priority tasks to focus on each day. Channel your energy into these instead of spreading yourself thin.\\n4. **Let go of guilt:**\\n    1. Remind yourself that doing less is not failure - it\u2019s a strategic choice to dedicate your best efforts to what truly matters.\\n\\n### The Takeaway\\n\\nFeeling overwhelmed isn\u2019t a sign of weakness - it\u2019s a signal to reassess and refocus. By doing less, you can free yourself from guilt, make meaningful progress, and give your best to the commitments that matter most.\\n\\n### Ask yourself \\n\\n1. Imagine your life from scratch, commitment free. How would you feel? How will it be different?\\n2. Now when the slate is clean. Which commitments on your plate are the most meaningful to you?\\n3. What\u2019s one promise or task you can let go of?\\n4. What\u2019s one area of your life where you could set clearer boundaries to protect your time and energy?\\n\\n%%"},{"id":"dont-be-a-black-box","metadata":{"permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/dont-be-a-black-box","source":"@site/blog/dont-be-a-black-box---give-us-a-hint-synthesis.md","title":"Dont Be a Black Box - Give Us a Hint","description":"Ever tried coding without knowing the inputs?","date":"2024-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Communication","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/communication","description":"Understanding and improving communication skills"}],"readingTime":7.045,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20230329173511,"Created":"2023-03-29 17:35","Modified":"2024-06-20 07:44","tags":["communication"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"being understood is easier when it is explicit","ContentStatus":"Published","Version":1,"aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"dont-be-a-black-box","date":"2024-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Say Yes To Less","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/say-yes-to-less"},"nextItem":{"title":"Free Will is to Be Limited by Oneself","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/free-will-is-to-be-limited"}},"content":"**Ever tried coding without knowing the inputs?**  \\nIt\'s messy, frustrating, and bound to fail, just like expecting others to read our minds in real life. Clear communication is our real-world \\"type hint\\", and if we really want to avoid confusion, a good \\"docstring\\" helps too.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What\'s in the Box?!\\n\\nReading other people\'s minds would be an incredible superpower\u2014who wouldn\'t want to be like Professor X (minus the disability)? It would be like flying on a magic carpet, suddenly exploring a whole new world. However, there is only one Professor X, and he is purely fictional. For us, other people\'s thoughts will always remain hidden. To us humans, other minds are like black boxes; we simply have no way of knowing what is going on inside. We can\'t access their motives, beliefs, values, or reasons for acting the way they do. But as haters of Uncertainty, we feel compelled to know what\'s in that box\u2014or at least convince ourselves that we do.\\n\\nUnfortunately, our Curiosity is often matched by our laziness. Like someone who looks up spoilers for their favorite show, the easiest way to \\"know\\" what\'s inside the box is to rely on assumptions. We tend to believe that others\' reasons, beliefs, and values mirror our own, which can be a trap.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will explore the potential downsides of making assumptions about other people\'s minds. We\'ll discuss why, even if we could witness every thought, we might still be left in the dark. Finally, we\u2019ll propose a potential solution inspired by programming\u2014using type hints and docstrings\u2014to make the black box a bit more clearer.\\n\\n## When You Assume You Make An....\\n\\nAs the saying goes, assumptions are for donkeys\u2014or something like that. It should be no surprise that if understanding our own mind is so challenging, then grasping someone else\'s mind should be nearly impossible.\\n\\nThe first and foremost reason is that people are fundamentally different from us. Shocking, I know. It\'s not just that others have different reasons and values that drive their actions; even their logical reasoning can vary. This means that even if two people share the same motivations, they might still act differently. For instance, when feeling sad, some people prefer to be around others, seeking comfort and talking through their feelings. Others, when sad, prefer solitude, working through their emotions on their own. Same reasons, different actions.\\n\\nMoreover, people behave differently depending on the Context. We are constantly influenced by the environment around us, which means we might act one way with our friends and another way at work or with family. It\u2019s like how returning to your parents\' house can make you feel like the kid you once were.\\n\\nAnd even if, by some miracle, we manage to truly understand someone and predict how they will act in every situation\u2014that\'s great! But remember, you\'ll have to start all over again in a day, a month, or a year because people are always changing. Denying this is to deny our humanity and the inherent ability to change according to our beliefs. Therefore, any expectation we form about someone else comes with an expiration date.\\n\\n## Don\'t Skip if You Can\'t Read Minds\\n\\nIf you didn\u2019t skip this section, then welcome to the club\u2014you\u2019re one of us! Hurray! We \u201cnormal\u201d people (if such a term can even be used) have to navigate understanding others without the benefit of mind reading. And just to make you feel a bit better, you should know that even if we could have that ability, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily help us understand others any better (sorry, Professor X).\\n\\nEven the field of Human Brain research, with all its promise of uncovering the secrets of the mind, is finding it increasingly challenging to pinpoint where \u201cwe\u201d\u2014our consciousness\u2014reside within that pink blob of ours. Motives and intentions can be elusive, even if all our inner transmissions were laid bare for everyone to see.\\n\\nTrue understanding requires more than just transparency; it needs active efforts to communicate. In programming, for example, everything is always visible\u2014there are no \\"hidden lines of code.\\" Every action can be traced back to its origin. But if you think this means all code is equally easy to understand, you are, unfortunately, very, very, very wrong. Writing clean, clear code that is easy to understand requires effort, knowledge, and intention.\\n\\nSimilarly, understanding another person\'s mind is extremely difficult without effort and intention from them to help you understand. By providing translation, a map to guide others through the twists and turns of our minds, we can achieve a level of understanding that even a mind reader couldn\u2019t reach. A mind reader would likely get lost in the maze, just as we do when we try to assume what\u2019s in someone else\u2019s mind.\\n\\n## Anybody Has a Map?\\n\\n\\"Does anybody have a map?  \\nAnybody maybe happen to know how the hell to do this?  \\nI don\'t know if you can tell  \\nBut this is me just pretending to know  \\nSo where\'s the map?  \\nI need a clue  \\n\'Cause the scary truth is  \\nI\'m flyin\' blind  \\nI\'m making this up as I go.\\"\\n\\nCouldn\'t have said it better. These lyrics from *Dear Evan Hansen* capture the helplessness of trying to understand someone else without a map to guide you.\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve come this far, let\u2019s explore how we can prepare and deliver our own \\"maps\\" to others. In programming, we call these \\"type hints\\" and \\"docstrings\\"\u2014explanations that accompany the main code to make it much clearer. Others who attempt to understand and use our code can rely on these hints to know when it\'s relevant, what inputs are needed for it to work, and what outputs they can expect.\\n\\nInterestingly, these are the exact criteria we could use to make ourselves more understandable in our personal lives:\\n1. **Context** - What situations trigger a specific emotional reaction in you? For instance, introverts might feel uncomfortable in large crowds, or certain words may make you feel loved, ashamed, afraid, etc.\\n2. **Inputs** - What can be done to avoid negative outcomes and create a better experience for both parties? If I know the trigger words, I can avoid them, and together we can find more acceptable terms to use.\\n3. **Outputs** - What is likely to happen if we maintain the current situation versus adjusting our inputs? How does a certain action make me feel? Why is it important?\\n\\nAn example combining these elements might look like this:  \\n\\"Hey honey, I wanted to tell you that when you come home and leave your shoes in the bedroom, it makes me agitated (**Outputs**). When I grew up, we always kept our shoes next to the door (**Context**). To me, taking off shoes at the door symbolizes being truly home (**Outputs**), while guests kept their shoes on. So, would it be okay if you left your shoes by the door when you walk in? (**Inputs**)\\"\\n\\nThese hints are useful tools for establishing healthy Boundaries in your life. However, they don\u2019t need to be presented as ultimatums. Instead, they can be part of a conversation where the primary goal is mutual understanding. As with any interaction, first seek to understand, then to be understood. Developing better communication skills is key to improving your well-being, and, of course, both parties must feel comfortable in the process.\\n\\nAnd remember\u2014not to forget! When someone has taken the time to provide a \\"map\\" to their mind, it\u2019s crucial to use it. If they\'ve made the effort to explain themselves, the least we can do is keep it in mind. Logging can be a helpful tool for that!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nMind reading is overrated\u2014we barely focus on our own thoughts, so who needs more of those? Instead, to understand others and to be understood by them, we simply need to make the implicit explicit. Don\u2019t assume it\u2019s obvious, and don\u2019t assume others see things the way you do. Just say it. You\u2019d be surprised how often five minutes of conversation can solve hours of struggle. \\n\\nYou don\u2019t have to spell everything out, just provide a few hints here and there, like a good programmer. Make your mind more readable by drawing a map for others to follow.\\n\\nLet me know what you think about communication, boundaries and every thing in between, and until then -\\nEmbrace, enrich and evolve.\\n\\n## Further Reading\\nOther books related to healthy communication\\nThe 5 Love Languages (book)\\n\\n%%"},{"id":"free-will-is-to-be-limited","metadata":{"permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/free-will-is-to-be-limited","source":"@site/blog/free-will-is-to-be-limited-by-oneself-synthesis.md","title":"Free Will is to Be Limited by Oneself","description":"Is free will about giving in, or taking control?","date":"2024-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Self-Control","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/self-control","description":"How to take control of your life and make better decisions"},{"inline":false,"label":"Personal-Identity","permalink":"/personal-website-docusaurus/blog/tags/personal-identity","description":"Who are you?

Real free will is an internal agreement, a collaboration between all parts of yourself. It takes compromise, creativity, and the courage to listen to your whole self.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What is Free Will Anyway?\\n\\nWe often think that having free will, if it even exists, is synonymous with having Self-control\u2014the ability for our will to overcome resistance so we can act according to our true desires. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, so let\u2019s start.\\n\\nThe first and most significant issue is the term \\"self-control.\\" Who, exactly, is the one in control, and who is being controlled? It\u2019s as if we\u2019re on one side of a conflict, locked in an endless battle against a mysterious foe that resides within us. \\n\\nIn reality, we are actually on both sides of the conflict simultaneously. When we seek self-control, we are essentially fighting against ourselves. And if you fight yourself, no matter who wins, you always lose.\\n\\nIn this post, I suggest that free will is not about control, and certainly not about subduing or overpowering parts of ourselves. Rather than a \\"simple\\" binary state of conflict, I propose a more nuanced definition that might sound counterintuitive at first\u2014but hear me out.\\n\\nTo have free will means to set limitations on yourself, by yourself, through a process of internal deliberation and harmony. I know that sounds complex, so let\u2019s break it down.\\n\\n## The Illusion of Unbridled Freedom\\n\\nLet\'s take a closer look at our internal state of conflict. If we imagine \\"us\\" battling against some part of ourselves, what exactly is that part? Typically, we see these things as our internal desires, the primal urges, or our default behaviors. What would happen if we allowed that side to act as it pleases?\\n\\nFor many of us, this is the default way of life\u2014or at least where a significant portion of our attention and time is devoted. We feel these urges deep within, like a volcano on the verge of eruption, with an inner voice growing louder and louder until we finally respond. These desires often manifest in the form of things that bring immediate pleasure, such as food, entertainment, or sex. Even our social needs find instant gratification through scrolling social media, where we experience and explore other people\'s lives (or at least their perceived image of them).\\n\\nIn essence, when left to \\"our own devices,\\" we surrender our free will to basic chemistry and biology. Our minds, which are attuned to seek gratification, find endless opportunities in the modern world.\\n\\nThis isn\'t accidental, of course. The economy of recent centuries has evolved to provide quicker and more satisfying answers to these fundamental desires, with fast food, pocket-sized entertainment, and an unlimited supply of \\"stuff\\" we can own.\\n\\nIgnoring the conflict between our desires and our will doesn\'t leave us in a neutral state. The world around us is shaped to influence us on the deepest and most powerful levels possible, meaning that even inaction is a decision of sorts. \\n\\nBy mindlessly following our desires, we end up pitting ourselves against the collective efforts of an entire economy\u2014one that is expertly designed to capture and hold our attention. In such a battle, it\'s easy to predict who the winner will be.\\n\\n## The Tyranny of Partial Self-Control\\n\\nIf our internal urges can be so harmful, then we must control them... right? After all, by relinquishing our desire for control, it seems we won\'t be guided toward our own happiness, but rather end up satisfying a biological urge or someone else\'s economic ambitions.\\n\\nSo, we might think we have no choice but to take control. But as we mentioned earlier, who exactly are we fighting? Are humans simply a mix of desires, some \\"good\\" and some \\"bad,\\" that we must eliminate?\\n\\nAt best, this approach denies our humanity as biological beings, suggesting we are nothing more than noble aspirations. At worst\u2014and more realistically\u2014we end up declaring war on ourselves, believing we need to conquer, subdue, and eradicate any parts we consider harmful.\\n\\nFighting against ourselves is a path to self-destruction, almost by definition. It involves wasting mental energy, focus, and time resisting something intrinsic to us, overlooking its potential benefits, and reducing the complexity of our humanity.\\n\\nFor instance, without the part of our brain that drives us to seek pleasure, we would become completely apathetic, lacking motivation to do anything, whether \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\" Without so-called \\"negative\\" emotions like anger or frustration, what would compel us to seek justice or strive for improvement? By labeling ourselves \\"weak,\\" \\"lazy,\\" or \\"fragile,\\" do we genuinely stand a chance of becoming better, or are we just sinking deeper into despair?\\n\\nIt\'s like trying to \\"will yourself\\" into not needing sleep. After all, sleep takes up so many hours of the day that could be spent being more productive or having more experiences. But as we know, when we sleep less, we tend to be less productive.\\n\\nWhen we treat ourselves as potential enemies who can\'t be trusted, how can we ever achieve inner peace? It seems that in our attempt to exercise free will, we may only end up with the opposite result.\\n\\n## Free Will as Harmonious Coexistence\\n\\nWhat are we supposed to do if we can\'t simply let our inner urges run wild or try to control them? The answer\u2014difficult as it is and counterintuitive as it may sound\u2014is to reach an agreement. An agreement on which limitations we should impose on ourselves. These self-imposed limitations are the true symbol of free will.\\n\\nThere is beauty and Truth in all of our aspects, like organs working together to form a body, each with its own role. If one side forces another into submission, you don\'t achieve free will\u2014you create dysfunction, like cancer. Free will is an act that arises from your entire being, which is a combination of all those different voices.\\n\\nHowever, those voices don\'t always need equal say. Deliberation isn\'t necessarily a purely democratic process\u2014at least not in the simple political sense where one person equals one vote. But in another sense, it is the most democratic thing there is, because it requires understanding across all perspectives and consensus on what the best course of action is. There is no \\"one truth\\" that grants any single side eternal authority; instead, roles can rotate depending on the Context.\\n\\nInitially, compromises will likely be necessary. It\'s not easy to change or reach an agreement when we are accustomed to a particular pattern. However, in the long run, we may achieve an optimal point where all those voices align in the same direction. This will require effort and time to develop the necessary virtues to create a synthesis of yourself.\\n\\nThat synthesis will not only be the true reflection of who you are\u2014your authenticity\u2014but it will also represent the only true act of free will you can have.\\n\\nThe first step, as always, is to develop Self-awareness. This means really listening to our inner voices while also understanding that, like people, those voices can always change and grow. More on that in another post, but a useful tool could be journaling, to record your thoughts, feelings, and emotions for the present and as a reflective tool.\\n\\nI don\'t want to provide too many examples, as it might diminish the gravity of the topic, but here are a couple of actions that can result from such an agreement\u2014a form of self-limitation. For example, Temptation Bundling is a powerful tool that combines both our desire for pleasure and our will to do what\'s right or necessary. Similarly, viewing failure as an opportunity to improve can help us convert frustration into motivation, thus honoring both our emotions and our growth process.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhether you don\'t assume any control over your actions or you believe that free will means letting the rational side dominate, in both cases, you end up becoming a slave\u2014to yourself. Either you give in to temptations without limitations, or you listen only to one part of yourself. Free will is about simultaneously freeing and limiting yourself because a true will is the combination of all the sides within you that must come to an agreement. That agreement requires compromise, creativity, and adaptations to accommodate all the different perspectives within you.\\n\\nLet me know what you think about free will, self control and every thing in between, and until then -\\nEmbrace, enrich and evolve\\n\\n## Further Reading\\nEthics of ambiguity (book)\\n\\n%%"}]}}')}}]);
