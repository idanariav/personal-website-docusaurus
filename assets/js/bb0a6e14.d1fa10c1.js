FFor example: "I always choose the job with better pay," "I must take two courses a year," or "I never say no to a gig." These rules are similar to the philosophy of deontology, which argues that some actions are prohibited and others are mandatory based on universal truths. This approach suggests that if we think hard enough, we can find truths as self-evident as 1+1=2.
