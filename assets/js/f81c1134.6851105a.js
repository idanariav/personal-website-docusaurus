We all see ourselves as a \\"diamond in the rough.\\" \\n\\nWe believe that beneath our rough edges and unresolved issues lies our \\"true self.\\" Everything that stands in our way of becoming that self is merely impulses or random thoughts, which can be distractions at best or even enemies to suppress, like the craving for sugar when we want to eat healthily. These are our \\"inner demons\\" or \\"animalistic nature,\\" but they are certainly not part of us.\\n\\nAvoiding these urges is not simple, but it pales in comparison to the meaningful yet paralyzing moments in life when we must decide who we want to be. Which job should I pursue? Where do I want to live? What do I want to do with my life? Each choice feels both right and wrong simultaneously, as we are filled with conflicting voices that seem like a part of \\"us.\\"\\n\\nAs agonizing as it sounds, I believe these internal conflicts are a feature, not a bug, of being human. Having multiple voices within us makes more sense when we realize we contain multiple identities, each with its own unique quirks and persona (this is only a metaphor, setting schizophrenia aside). \\"We are condemned to be free,\\" said Sartre. The choice of who we are at any given moment is difficult, yet it is ours to make; no one else can make it for us. This is the price of having a rich (and free) identity.\\n\\nMaking choices would be much easier if we had only one value or identity to live by. However, it would also make life shallow and unbalanced. Consider people who dedicate themselves entirely to a single cause - workaholics and extreme altruists alike quickly experience burnout as they realize the cost of what they have sacrificed, such as relationships, creative pursuits, and leisure.\\n\\nBut where does our multiplicity come from? We can identify three major sources:\\n1. Time\\n2. People\\n3. Environment\\n\\nLet\'s start with time. Although we change over time, we do not completely detach ourselves from our past. Like covering a wall with fresh paint, the old layer still lies beneath. We may still be affected by baggage, past traumas, and scars that continue to hurt. We might find ourselves boxed into a path chosen by our past selves, such as a degree or a marriage. The choice was made long ago, but it still influences the present.\\n\\nOur future self is equally alive in the present moment. By imagining who we want to become, it is as if we bring them to life just by thinking about them - a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.\\n\\nWe also act differently depending on who we are with. The \\"work self\\" is very different from the \\"with friends self\\" (shoutout to all the Severance fans). It\u2019s not just that we act differently; we are different. We perceive the world through different lenses, altering our thoughts, priorities, and behavior. Each person sees different fragments of us, which together form a complex mosaic.\\n\\nPause and ask yourself how much of who you are today results from your relationships with others. Whether you have copied their behavior, been shaped by shared experiences, or developed traits to counteract harmful attitudes, we are who we are because of the people we associate with. William James said, \\"We are like islands in the sea, separate on the surface but connected in the deep.\\"\\n\\nAside from astronauts, most of us do not exist in a vacuum. Our environment is as much a part of ourselves as the soil is to a plant. Our surroundings shape us, sending cues that translate into actions, thoughts, and feelings. For example, taking a walk calms us, while a dark, confined space might make us feel tired or fearful. So, which one is our \\"true self\\"? Is it the one who thrives outdoors or the one who feels scared?\\n\\nFrom our genes to social groups to space-time itself, we are a vast multitude of beings - a beehive of identities working together for a common(-ish) cause. Once we accept that, we can find greater peace with who we are.\\n\\nKnowing this is only half the battle. Recognizing the different voices as competing identities is helpful, but how do we get them to agree, or at least quiet down?\\n\\nThe first step is to shift from a \\"one voice above all\\" mentality, where terms like \\"self-control\\" and \\"grit\\" dominate the conversation, to a more \\"democratic\\" and deliberative approach.\\n\\nStart listening to those voices. It might help to give them personas; for me, it works best if these personas are fictional. This way, they can represent a single, pure idea without the complexities of using an existing person for your inner dialogue.\\n\\nTogether, I consider what they would have done, what my future self would do, or what my past self would have wanted in that situation. Which of my core values should I prioritize if they don\'t overlap?\\n\\nSometimes, the big decisions in life are too much for one person to handle. Using the perspectives of all our inner voices can provide more information to work with when making a choice. Perhaps our procrastination is not a vice to overcome but rather a sign that we are doing something we dislike. \\"(He) who looks inside, awakes,\\" said Carl Jung. Through self-reflection, we gain much more than information; we bring harmony to who we are.\\n\\nTrusting your past self, who made the right decision at the time, or allowing your future self to guide you can help you navigate life more calmly, even amid rough storms, knowing exactly where you want to go and that you don\'t have to go there alone.\\n\\n![council of selves (Insight).webp](/posts/council-of-selves-insight.webp)"},{"id":"work-in-progress","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/work-in-progress","source":"@site/blog/you-are-always-a-work-in-progress-insight.md","title":"You are always a work in progress","description":"Are you truly aware of the depths of your potential for growth?

We humans also change, though perhaps in more subtle ways.\\n\\nCompared to other animals, we are born helpless. However, thanks to our ability to learn and grow, we evolve from babies into mature, capable adults. Our development extends beyond the physical; our minds, values, and even our identities can change as well.\\n\\nAt age 20, I believed I had finally discovered who I am. I confidently repeated this belief at 25, again at 30, and I will likely do so again at 35. In hindsight, we can see how much we\'ve changed, yet we often believe that *now* we have reached the finish line - that \\"this is it\\" and that this is who we will be until the day we die.\\n\\nI\'m here to tell you: you are always a work in progress.\\n\\nDon\'t assume your current skill level reflects your potential, nor that your current \\"vices\\" are a permanent stain on your identity.\\n\\nWhile there may be some truth to the idea that we have a \\"core identity\\" or \\"talent\\" that limits our potential, it is more accurate to say that \\"the mind makes it real.\\" When we believe we have reached our limits, we become static. By believing we can change, we expand our possibilities.\\n\\nKierkegaard said, \\"Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.\\" Looking back, we can see how far we\'ve come; the pieces of our lives make sense, and we can trace the twisting yet connected path that has led us to who we are today. We must extend that belief into the future as well. We need to overcome the innate feeling that \\"our identity is fixed\\" so we can shape our journey of change moving forward. The path we were on hasn\'t ended; the way ahead is simply hidden from us.\\n\\nChange is the one true constant of life. As Heraclitus said, \\"No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river, and he\'s not the same man.\\" Some ancient Greeks, like Heraclitus, believed that human nature mirrors nature itself - the rules of the cosmos govern people as well. Therefore, if nature is in constant flux, then so are we.\\n\\nThe question is not whether we are capable of change, but how we will change. Like revolving gears, some parts of ourselves shift faster - perhaps our professions or interests - while others change more slowly, like our values and core beliefs.\\n\\nWe are always in the process of becoming, changing from the moment we are born until the day we die.\\n\\nTherefore, life is a journey, not a destination. It is not about reaching a \\"perfect version of ourselves\\" - we will never get there. Not because we are incapable of improvement, but because our idea of a \\"perfect self\\" evolves with us. It\'s like trying to reach the end of a rainbow; it keeps slipping away, distancing itself with every step we take.\\n\\nNietzsche once wrote, \\"What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal.\\" We are always in the process of surpassing ourselves, moving from one identity to the next, rather than unveiling a specific version of ourselves. Kierkegaard claimed, \\"The self is a relation that relates itself to itself.\\" If you need a moment to process that, it\'s fine. Essentially, it means that our identity resembles the paper art children create of people holding hands. What makes us \\"us\\" (the elusive \\"self\\" that separates us from others) is that all the identities we adopt and replace throughout the years *feel* connected to each other, which creates a sense of continuity.\\n\\nWhile a final destination is unattainable, we can surpass many milestones along the way. Who we are today is merely an image, a temporary version of ourselves - the best use of our potential *so far* - but hardly the best we can achieve throughout our lifetimes. Use the words \\"yet\\" and \\"so far\\" as your guiding principles, such as \\"I can\'t do that yet\\" or \\"this is the best I\'ve achieved so far.\\"\\n\\nBy embracing the spirit of change and being \\"a work in progress,\\" we are not bound by our past or by limiting thoughts about ourselves. Our potential is much greater, and our limits extend much farther than we think.\\n\\n## Further Reading"},{"id":"walking-a-tight-rope","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/walking-a-tight-rope","source":"@site/blog/walking-a-tight-rope-synthesis.md","title":"Walking a Tight Rope","description":"Is living a good and happy life truly an impossible balancing act?

We aim to achieve great things in life, but this often comes at a high cost, such as neglecting our relationships. We seek a calling, yet we often face either an overwhelming number of options or none at all.\\n\\nIf only life were that simple, but it is quite the opposite. Finding a meaningful goal and committing to it is challenging enough. On top of that, we grapple with competing values that pull us in different directions, making every step forward a struggle.\\n\\nDespite how difficult it may seem, I believe this complexity is a fundamental aspect of being human. To illustrate this, let\'s explore alternative ways of living.\\n\\nKierkegaard identified two types of unsatisfying lives:\\n\\n1. Being lost in the finite - dedicating yourself entirely to one project and becoming one with it, spending all your time, thoughts, and focus on it.\\n2. Being lost in the infinite - attempting to \\"do it all,\\" succumbing to FOMO with an endless pursuit of an ever-growing wish list, and feeling a constant need to change your life and try something new.\\n\\nI would add a third option that he overlooked:\\n\\n3. The concept of \\"philosophical suicide\\" as described by Camus - giving up entirely and living without striving for anything \\"special\\" in life, feeling that everything is meaningless or arbitrary.\\n\\nI believe we oscillate between these ideas rather than fixating on just one.\\n\\nWe may immerse ourselves in our jobs, working long hours at the expense of friendships and sleep. Once we reach the top, we might feel compelled to compensate for what we missed, attempting to check everything off our bucket list. Yet, along the way, we may experience an indescribable emptiness despite fulfilling many dreams.\\n\\nWe often gravitate toward one of these options because it provides certainty. In our quest for life\'s meaning, we tend to choose the most convenient option available, regardless of its truth. Living with uncertainty, constantly questioning the big issues without answers, is frustrating, to say the least.\\n\\nBut what is the alternative? To walk a tightrope above the abyss of being human:\\n\\n\u2022 To commit to a cause while remembering that we are not defined by a single aspect of our lives.\\n\u2022 To choose a path, even if it feels arbitrary like many others, knowing we may never see its end.\\n\u2022 To strive for improvement while embracing our imperfect selves.\\n\\nThere is no easy answer to where this balance lies, but it is the only answer we have.\\n\\nWe can debate, argue, and deny, but just as the Earth revolves around the sun despite our beliefs, we cannot escape the abyss.\\n\\nWe can only decide how to cross it.\\n\\nThis is a journey you must undertake on your own. No one can make the choice for you, and be cautious of those who promise you \\"the truth to a good life.\\"\\n\\nThat answer will likely evolve over time, just as you do, and that\'s perfectly okay.\\n\\nThis is why my slogan is \\"join the journey.\\" I don\'t have all the answers for you, but together, we might find some inspiration.\\n\\n## Ask Yourself\\n\\n1. What does being a \\"good person\\" mean to me, and how do I strive to embody that in my daily life?\\n2. In what areas of my life do I feel I am sacrificing one value for another? How can I create a better balance?\\n3.

We are too busy, too tired or so against complexity that we tend to decide based on heuristics.\\n\\nHeuristics are automated decision rules, like \\"more is always better\\" or \\"free beats quality\\".\\n\\nThe good thing about heuristics is that in many cases they work just fine, that\'s how they became automatic. Bad rules that lead to bad outcomes aren\'t automated, unless...\\n\\nUnless we\'re talking about the long term. Heuristics are great for short-term decision-making, but bad for the long term because thinking about the 8th chess move ahead is much harder than thinking about the very next one. Such complexity can\'t be easily translated into a simple rule, which is why it\'s often neglected.\\n\\nFor example, the prisoners\' dilemma is a problem of heuristics. Each person chooses the betray to maximize their well-being, even though the overall outcome is worse for both sides.\\n\\nCompare that to a repeating prisoners\' dilemma where tit-for-tat (aka kindness) is the winning strategy.\\n\\nThe bigger the decision, the more we must abandon our heuristics, and think about positioning.\\n\\nPositioning means looking beyond the current decision into the next one. It\'s asking ourselves what is becoming harder/impossible to do and vice versa. Which choices help me become better positioned for the future.\\n\\nClassic cases of improving our positioning are physical fitness, being financially responsible, avoiding addictions or distractions, and learning and growing.\\n\\nPreparing for the future might be hard and not rewarding at first, but it makes our lives so much easier. Instead of running from crisis to crisis, being forced to make bad decisions, and feeling stuck, we are always moving up.\\n\\nLike leveling up in DND, we improve with time, ready to handle the scary monsters life is going to throw at us.\\n\\nHowever, positioning isn\'t free. Choosing to learn a new course over resting to be \\"better prepared for the future job market\\", taking more stuff with you on camping \\"just in case\\", or investing less so you can have emergency money are all costly decisions.\\n\\nTime is scarce, and each decision comes at the cost of not doing something else. So balance between improving your positioning and the alternative cost of what you\'re missing out.\\n\\n## Ask Yourself\\n- What decisions am I making today that can limit or expand my future options?\\n- Which habits or actions position me for better choices later?\\n- Am I optimizing for now or setting myself up for the future I want?\\n\\n## The Bottom line\\n\\nSome decisions are important and impactful enough that we should consider their long-term effect. By doing so, we can choose the path that improves our positioning, making future problems easier or nonexistent.\\n\\nInstead of running from crisis to crisis, we can be on the path that avoids them entirely.\\n\\nArchimedes said: \u201CGive me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.\\n\\nPositioning, while not free, is a great multiplier that makes good decisions less costly and much more impactful."},{"id":"rigid-vs-flexible-rules","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/rigid-vs-flexible-rules","source":"@site/blog/rigid-vs-flexible-rules-insight.md","title":"Rigid Vs Flexible Rules","description":"Is it better to live by rigid rules that offer clarity\u2014or flexible ones that offer resilience?","date":"2025-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Habits","permalink":"/blog/tags/habits","description":"Building and maintaining good habits"},{"inline":false,"label":"Self-Control","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-control","description":"How to take control of your life and make better decisions"}],"readingTime":3.22,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20250608191328,"Created":"2025-06-08 19:13","Modified":"2025-06-10 22:59","tags":["habits","control"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"What is better for our wellbeing and development?

They live consistently by their moral code, which is more than most of us can say.\\n\\nThere\'s power in having creeds. When we have an unbreakable rule, such as \\"I don\'t eat meat\\", it makes life easier because we don\'t have to debate each time whether we should eat meat or not. The expectations are clear.\\n\\nAlso, we can\'t make excuses - like \\"nuggets are not really meat because it\'s chicken\\". There\'s no one else to fool but ourselves.\\n\\nSuch rules are likely to become our second nature. With time, discipline turns to automatic behavior, becoming our default.\\n\\nHowever, every rule is bound to be broken, whether by mistake, bad luck, laziness, or enough pressure, we will slip up.\\n\\nWhen rigid rules are broken, they are broken \\"big time\\". These rules are so entrenched in our identity, that when they break - we break. Our motivation collapses, and there\'s no going back now.\\n\\nLike a person with 2000 days streak on Duolingo that skipped a single day (without streak freezes), they\'ll likely delete the app and stop learning for months if not ever.\\n\\nIf you don\'t want to put all your eggs in the \\"rigid rule\\" basket, you can choose to have flexible rules, like \\"I try to avoid eating meat\\". It doesn\'t mean you never eat meat, and (unfortunately) it\'s up to you to decide what counts as following this rule.\\n\\nOn the bright side, failing to uphold this rule is not as shattering as breaking a rigid rule. Even if you fail by your standards, you can get back up. The fall isn\'t that high.\\n\\nYou can reflect on your choices, what led to your failure, and what can you do better next time. You can also improve your standards with time. At first \\"avoid eating meat\\" can be translated as eating meat every other day, and with time it can be \\"only on special occasions\\".\\n\\nFlexible rules acknowledge our humanity, the good and the bad.\\n\\nYes, we can lie to ourselves and make excuses, but it also allows us to adjust based on our circumstances, and to get back up after we fall.

Who would hate good things? Sounds obvious that we would enjoy or at most ignore them, but hate them?\\n\\nLet\u2019s explain with a story. You\u2019re at work, your projects are piling up along with the stress, and you do what you can to not fall behind, and suddenly your coworker comes to you _again_ with questions that they should have known by now. It has become a routine, they come to you with questions, so much so that you can\u2019t barely keep up with your own work. Frustrating, right?\\n\\nMaybe you had a tough day and all you want to do is to have a date night with your partner, but when they come home they say a quick \u201Chello\u201D and start doing house chores. You wait for them to talk to you but they\u2019re just so focused on other things that you feel ignored.\\n\\nThe more obvious, common-place takeaway from these stories is that we need to communicate better, and have clearer boundaries and expectations. However, there\u2019s a different message I would like to discuss.\\n\\nThe problem starts with how we judge these interactions. Even if they don\u2019t go as you want them to, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re inherently \u201Cbad\u201D\\n\\nIt is shocking how many conflicts are caused because people have different perceptions of what is considered \u201Cgood\u201D or a desired outcome.\\n\\nWe are so entrenched in how we see the world, and how the interaction affects us, that we fail to see the values and motives behind the other\u2019s actions.\\n\\n\u201CNagging\u201D Colleagues trust you, they value you as their mentor, and they acknowledge your expertise. Perhaps they are frustrated that it\u2019s a one-way connection, that they can\u2019t help you the way that you help them.\\n\\nYour partner probably tried to take care of things so that you could relax. They have expressed their care using their love language, which might be different than your own.\\n\\nWould you have liked to be someone who is ignored or whose opinions teammates undervalue? Would you want your partner to be self-centered, rather than expressing their love the way they know how?\\n\\nEven if the method or the final result is not optimal, usually the interactions in our close relationships are based on care, respect, and empathy.\\n\\nSaying it, and feeling it are two different things.\\n\\nOur default is to judge the situation from our perspective, it\u2019s crazy to think that we can be a perfect stoic, an unbiased observer at all times. By default, we will get angry, frustrated, or disappointed.\\n\\nThe question is what do we do the moment after we feel these feelings.\\n\\nI can\u2019t stop myself from feeling it, but I can choose how to act on it. On my better days, I stop and ask myself \u201CDid they try to do good?\u201D\\n\\nAlmost always the answer is yes, but simply asking myself that question calms me down. It allows me ever so slightly to get out of my head, and have a glimpse of how they see the world.\\n\\nInstead of my \u201Cgood\u201D and their \u201Cgood\u201D, we can create together \u201Cour good\u201D, a basis for shared understanding and cooperation.\\n\\nSo don\u2019t hate the good, see what lies behind it, and heck, you might even like it.\\n\\n## Ask yourself\\n\\n1. Have you had times where you tried to do good, but received frustration in return?\\n2. When was the last time I got mad? What has caused it?\\n3. What were the intentions behind the other person\'s actions?\\n4. Could there be a more optimistic/altruistic reason for it?\\n5. How could you better communicate your reasons to others?\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe have a tendency to become frustrated, angry, or resent things that are actually good in our lives. Embracing, rather than denying the good in our lives is a matter of perspective, yet as is with any case of anger and frustration, we first have to stop, calm down, and reflect until we can see the positive side."},{"id":"are-we-capable-of-change","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/are-we-capable-of-change","source":"@site/blog/are-we-capable-of-change-synthesis.md","title":"Are We Capable of Change","description":"What if real change isn\u2019t about improving who you are, but becoming someone new entirely?","date":"2025-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Change","permalink":"/blog/tags/change","description":"Embracing change and adapting to new situations"},{"inline":false,"label":"Personal-Identity","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal-identity","description":"Who are you?

Could that something be our identity? And if so, what happens when we try to change it? This post explores why lasting personal growth requires more than surface tweaks, and what it really takes to transform.\\n\\n![are_we_capable_of_change.webp](/posts/are_we_capable_of_change.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nChances are, there are aspects of yourself that you wish to change. Even if we love ourselves (as we should), we often desire to be a bit better - more loving, outgoing, productive, less lazy, or less prone to Distractions. We all have something we\'d like to improve, yet we often doubt whether real change is possible.\\n\\nHow can we truly become someone different from who we are? When we attempt to change, it sometimes feels like there\'s a force holding us back, an anchor that keeps us in place. Perhaps this anchor is our \\"true identity,\\" making any meaningful change seem like a distant dream. We may believe that while small changes are possible, the significant ones are out of reach. But is this really true?\\n\\nWe often imagine change as a simple matter of swapping out traits, habits, or thoughts, as if we were replacing components on a list. However, this is more like playing a game of Jenga - remove or change too much, and the whole structure risks collapsing.\\n\\nThis collapse is the harsh reality of change: it\u2019s not easy, but it is a fundamental part of the process. Changing something significant about ourselves inevitably involves altering our identity. Once we accept that meaningful change requires us to adopt a new identity, we must also come to terms with letting go of the old one.\\n\\nIn essence, we can change, but in doing so, we transform who we are. It\'s almost like saying the same person doesn\u2019t change; rather, they are replaced by a slightly different version of themselves. Over time, these small shifts accumulate, resulting in a drastically different personality. This may sound extreme, but think about how different you were as a child. How much of who you are today can be traced back to who you were then? Some core tendencies might remain, perhaps a similar sense of humor, but your thoughts, values, and preferences have likely evolved dramatically. While you share the same body (more or less), you are hardly the same person anymore, and that\'s a good thing.\\n\\n## The Potential for Radical Transformation\\n\\nWe need to reconcile two seemingly conflicting truths about our identity. On one hand, we feel a strong sense of continuity in \\"who we are.\\" As we grow older, certain core aspects like being an introvert, our political ideologies, or our automatic reactions to specific triggers seem fixed and unchanging. However, scientific evidence increasingly shows that change is indeed possible. Perhaps more surprisingly, our actions shape our identity as much as our identity shapes our actions.\\n\\nWho we are and what we do are deeply interconnected, influencing each other in a continuous feedback loop.\\n\\nThis process is known as Habituation, driven by our brain\'s preference for energy efficiency. Our brains work to simplify decision-making by turning complex, mentally taxing choices into automatic habits. This self-reinforcing loop causes us to repeat certain behaviors without conscious thought. For example, brushing your teeth in the morning, checking your phone multiple times a day, or craving popcorn at the movies are all habits formed through repetition. While this tendency can be limiting, it is also liberating. Whatever change you seek to make may be challenging initially, but it will become easier as new habits form.\\n\\nIf you start eating healthier, over time, you\'ll find yourself craving salads as you once craved junk food. Acting kindly towards others makes us more compassionate, and practicing gratitude makes us more optimistic. Aristotle\u2019s assertion that by practicing virtue we become virtuous has finally been validated after 2,000 years. Change is a matter of building momentum; it\u2019s difficult to start, but once it gets rolling, it becomes unstoppable. Just like pushing a boulder over a hill, the initial push requires the most effort.\\n\\nBy adulthood, we\'re no longer \\"tabula rasa,\\" or blank slates, easily shaped and influenced. We accumulate habits, both good and bad, which become deeply ingrained. Because these habits are easy to perform, replacing them becomes a real challenge. This is why changing ingrained habits is like developing muscles, it requires a strong, decisive effort.\\n\\nYou can\'t \\"gently\\" abandon old habits; it takes a firm commitment to break away from them. If you have even a little willpower, now is the time to use it.\\n\\nThat said, change isn\'t about relying on willpower alone. Since habits form from repeated decisions, the key is to create an Environment where the \\"old you\\" finds it hard to thrive, and the \\"new you\\" finds it easier to emerge. For example, if you want to eat healthier, remove unhealthy snacks from your house and stock up on nutritious options. Smart change is not about facing temptation but about eliminating it. If your phone distracts you, \\"dumb\\" it down; if you lack empathy, challenge yourself to say three kind things to someone each day.\\n\\nIt will be painful and difficult at first, but the essential takeaway is that change is possible. Studies show that people aged 20 to 80 reported significant personal change over the past decade but anticipated little change in the next. We mistakenly believe our current selves are our final versions, but nothing could be further from the truth. New experiences lead to new habits, which in turn lead to new identities.\\n\\nWith each action we take, we move closer to our ideal selves. Who we are now is just a starting point, and who we wish to become is the goal. Our focus should be on charting the path from here to there, deciding what\u2019s worth keeping and, more importantly, what\u2019s worth discarding, and doing so with all the courage and resilience we have.\\n\\nYou can drastically change who you are because you already have. You are not the same person you were at 5, 10, or 15 years old, so why should now be any different?\\n\\n## Challenges of Transformation\\n\\nHow do we know if a change is truly beneficial? How can we be sure our desire to change comes from a genuine aspiration to improve rather than from a misguided direction? And if change is so valuable and positive, why is it often so difficult? Perhaps our natural resistance to change is not a flaw, but a feature.\\n\\nNo matter your perspective on change, it is undoubtedly intimidating, especially when we recognize how drastic and even disruptive it can be. Changing our identity is like moving a plant to a new climate; if we don\'t make the process gentle, the plant might not survive.\\n\\nAt first glance, it may seem contradictory to discuss change as both drastic and gentle. The distinction lies in the difference between form vs essence. The method of change, the form, must be decisive and powerful enough to uproot old habits and replace them with new ones. Trying to gently transition while still holding onto the past will likely fail, much like keeping temptations readily available in a rehab clinic.\\n\\nTo make change stick, we must show determination, resilience, and unwavering connection to our motivation, acting as if any other life is neither possible nor desirable.\\n\\nHowever, the essence of change, what we aim to become, should be a manageable shift from who we are now. Radical transformations, like going from a couch potato to a gym enthusiast overnight, or from a quiet introvert to a social butterfly, are unrealistic. Too much change at once can overwhelm us, leading to a backlash against the idea of change altogether. Humans can only handle so much transformation at a time; pushing beyond that limit risks triggering resistance, pain, or fear that can halt progress. The key is to recognize a continuity between who we are now and who we wish to become. The future version of ourselves must feel familiar enough that we don\u2019t feel like we are losing our identity entirely.\\n\\nWhen the change is too drastic, uncertainty grows exponentially, and this threatens us at our core. Uncertainty about who we will become, whether we will still enjoy the same things, or what our lives will look like generates existential fear, similar to the fear of death, because it feels like the end of our current identity. We experience this dread during pivotal moments in life, such as finishing school, getting married, or becoming parents.\\n\\nBy focusing on small, manageable changes, we can reduce this fear. We allow a connection to form between who we are now and who we want to be. It becomes, \\"I\'m still me, but a little healthier,\\" or \\"still me, but a bit more outgoing.\\" This approach maintains continuity between our different selves, like a council of evolving identities.\\n\\nThe magic happens when we realize how a series of small, manageable steps can lead to significant transformations over time.\\n\\n## Embracing the Process of Self-Transformation\\n\\nIn the TV show *Fullmetal Alchemist*, magicians can create extraordinary things, such as turning water into wine, using three fundamental principles:\\n\\n1. The ability to destroy, tearing apart what they touch.\\n2. The ability to reconstruct, using available resources to create something new.\\n3. The energy and extra materials needed to fuel the conversion.\\n\\nEvery meaningful change follows these three steps. First, we need the power to deconstruct. This means clearing space for who we want to become by breaking down habits and mindsets that hold us back. Next, we must have the ability to reconstruct. It\u2019s not enough to simply eliminate the old; we need to fill that newly created space with something new and better. Without this, we risk falling back into old patterns or being overwhelmed by a sense of emptiness. Finally, we need the energy to fuel this transformation\u2014the willpower and desire to stop the cycle of current behaviors and bring forth a new identity.\\n\\nThis process of transformation is not a one-time act; it\u2019s a lifelong journey. As long as we are alive, we have the potential to perform incredible feats of personal growth. By embracing this cycle of creative destruction and reconstruction, we open ourselves to becoming so much more. No change or identity is beyond our reach, as long as we understand that it requires time, effort, and vision. Our identity is not a fixed point but a dot on a spectrum of possibilities\u2014each version of ourselves slightly different from the last, yet all connected by a shared vision and history.\\n\\n## Conclusion: The Journey of Radical Change\\n\\nChange is often seen as something beyond our control, whether dictated by fate, biology, or the environment. While these forces may shape us, they don\'t have to hold us back. The reach of our potential is often limited only by the strength of our will. Many of us worry more about these perceived boundaries than we do about actually challenging them. If we commit to change with time, effort, and focus, we can dramatically transform ourselves, enriching our identity with growth and depth. Change is a journey\u2014are you ready to take the first step?\\n\\nThe boundaries of our personal development are shaped by the limits of our will, mind, and body. Interestingly, the more we understand these limits, the more we can push them. As we embark on this journey of growth, every step we take\u2014especially when guided by thoughtful planning and deep reflection\u2014helps us redefine who we are, what we value, and what our purpose is. This continuous self-discovery leads us deeper into understanding and expanding our potential.\\n\\nChange is the only constant in life. Our experiences and circumstances constantly evolve, challenging our identity and pushing us to adapt. Resisting this natural flow can lead to feelings of stress, frustration, and even victimhood. Conversely, accepting that change is inevitable allows us to flow with it, not against it. embracing this truth is not only more realistic but also more liberating. It enables us to grow into a more resilient and adaptable version of ourselves.\\n\\nThe first step toward meaningful change is acknowledging that change is not only possible but unavoidable. Instead of ignoring, resisting, or fearing change, we should focus on asking ourselves how we can grow for the better. What actions can we take today to move closer to the person we want to become? By embracing this mindset, we realize that our limits are farther away than we once believed. Circumstances do not dictate destiny, and while change is hard, it is never impossible. By adopting a \\"yes and\\" attitude, we can better navigate the flow of life and actively choose the direction we want to follow.\\n\\nWhen we view change as a choice rather than a mere occurrence, it becomes a profound exercise of our freedom. This freedom is not only about deciding what to do but also about choosing who we want to be. Although challenging, this journey is one of the most empowering, authentic, and liberating paths we can take.\\n\\nSo, what journey are you planning to embark on? What changes have always been on your bucket list but felt out of reach? What steps will you take today and tomorrow? Let these questions inspire you to take action and embrace the possibility of transformation.\\n\\n# ## Further Reading\\nmaster of change (book)\\nHow to change (book)\\nSwitch (book)"},{"id":"love-and-change","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/love-and-change","source":"@site/blog/self-love-and-change-insight.md","title":"Self Love and Change","description":"How can you truly change if change means rejecting who you are?","date":"2025-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Change","permalink":"/blog/tags/change","description":"Embracing change and adapting to new situations"},{"inline":false,"label":"Kindness","permalink":"/blog/tags/kindness","description":"Cultivating kindness in our lives"}],"readingTime":3.45,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20250425214552,"Created":"2025-04-25 21:45","Modified":"2025-04-25 21:45","Version":1,"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"To change ourselves, we have to first love ourselves","tags":["change","kindness"],"ContentStatus":"Published","aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"love-and-change","date":"2025-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Are We Capable of Change","permalink":"/blog/are-we-capable-of-change"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Joy of Doing Nothing","permalink":"/blog/happy-doing-nothing"}},"content":"**How can you truly change if change means rejecting who you are?**  \\nIt seems paradoxical: if self-love means accepting yourself, how can it also fuel transformation?

I would break me down to build myself back up again. \\n\\nThe \\"pain\\" of being hard towards myself seemed like the price I have to pay, similar to physical workouts where \\"no pain no gain\\".\\n\\nIt took me a while to see how harmful that perception was.\\n\\nImagine yourself as a captain of a ship. The ship is not great, you\'ve seen better. The color fades in places, some parts are rusty, and it is far from the dream boat that could take you where you want to go.\\n\\nWhat would happen if you hate that ship for all that it\'s not? For all it\'s flaws and imperfections? Hate won\'t magically turn it into your dream boat, on the contrary, you would either harm it yourself, or simply neglect it. Without proper maintenance and care, the ship would worsen even faster.\\n\\nAlternatively, if you loved the ship despite it\'s flaws, you would take good care of it. You would replace the broken parts, paint it every once in a while, and even invest time and money into improving it. It might never become your dream boat, but it will be the best boat you can have.\\n\\nYes, the metaphor was a bit \\"on the nose\\", but you get the picture. You can\'t grow into something beautiful out of self-hatred. Hatred is a vicious mindset, if we hate who we are now we would find things to hate even if/when we become better people. \\n\\nEven if we could push ourselves hard enough until good habits are the default, we would be miserable, feeling like slaves to ourselves, never good enough, never deserving love or appreciation. \\n\\nBut can we even change with that mindset? When we hate ourselves, what\'s the point of getting better? Hatred and belittling go hand in hand. We probably believe deep inside that at best we can only do marginal changes, or hide our bad qualities but never get rid of them. \\n\\nIt is a self-fulfilling prophecy of steady unhappiness, like being Sisyphus driving that rock up a hill. \\n\\nLoving ourselves is not narcissism. It is believing in our potential. Becoming a better person requires work from the \\"lesser\\" version of ourselves. Doing that work isn\'t easy so if we managed to change, it is only because we already possessed the qualities needed to do so.  \\n\\nTo love ourselves means to be our own gardener, to enjoy seeing ourselves blossom. .\\n\\nTo love ourselves means to love all the different parts of ourselves, the good and the bad, and all the versions of ourselves, past and future.\\n\\nWhile it is never easy being human, to balance between doing and being \\"more\\", with the satisfaction of who we are and what we have now, I hope that you have time to stop and appreciate yourself.\\n\\nSelf compassion will lessen the paradox, by increasing the satisfaction from who you are, while also giving you the strength to become better. \\n\\n## Further Reading\\n\\nMaster of Change (book)\\nThe Happiness Advantage (book)"},{"id":"happy-doing-nothing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/happy-doing-nothing","source":"@site/blog/the-joy-of-doing-nothing-insight.md","title":"The Joy of Doing Nothing","description":"What if doing nothing is the most productive thing you can do?","date":"2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Stillness","permalink":"/blog/tags/stillness","description":"Finding peace and stillness in a busy world"},{"inline":false,"label":"Creativity","permalink":"/blog/tags/creativity","description":"Exploring and enhancing your creative abilities"},{"inline":false,"label":"Recharge","permalink":"/blog/tags/recharge","description":"Methods recharge and rejuvenate"}],"readingTime":3.06,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20250214100535,"Created":"2025-02-14 10:05","Modified":"2025-04-14 14:58","tags":["stillness","creativity","recharge"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"Why doing nothing is both so hard and yet so essential","ContentStatus":"Published","Version":1.01,"aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"happy-doing-nothing","date":"2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Self Love and Change","permalink":"/blog/love-and-change"},"nextItem":{"title":"Morality is like Colors","permalink":"/blog/morality-is-like-colors"}},"content":"**What if doing nothing is the most productive thing you can do?**  \\nIn a world where time always feels scarce, we squeeze every moment for output, often at the cost of our creativity and peace of mind.

Usually something is hard because it\'s exhausting, because it demands our full attention and energy.

I could read, I could do chores, I could start an episode, or go to bed sooner.\\n\\nAs if five minutes were the \\"make or break\\" of my day, stopping the productivity train seemed wasteful and illogical.\\n\\nI (and probably most of you), have an urge to do something, to treat time as a resource that must be spend wisely, because how can we not?

This post explores the idea of \u201Cmoral primary colors\u201D and how understanding them could help bridge the gap between divided perspectives.\\n\\n![morality_like_colors.webp](/posts/morality_like_colors.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nWhen we look around we see an almost infinite range of colors, each seemingly standing on its own without any apparent connection to the others. However, we know that every color is just a different combination of a few \\"basic colors,\\" like red, green, and blue.\\n\\nMorality is quite similar in this sense. We observe a vast diversity of moral views, whether between societies or within them, there often seems to be a gap so wide that it\u2019s easy to think there is no common thread in morality at all - that it is entirely relative or perhaps even non-existent. Sure, different groups may agree on certain issues, but that often seems more like a strategic compromise than genuine moral alignment.\\n\\nHowever, I believe that there are \\"basic colors\\" of morality. abstract notions of virtues and values shared by all humans, just combined differently in each case. Similar to how every color can be represented by a combination of the same three primary colors, moral values can also be seen as combinations of foundational elements.\\n\\nKnowing how and why we are different won\'t cause us to magically agree with one another, but it would make understanding easier, and this is a good important step.\\n\\nHere, we will explore what these \\"basic moral colors\\" might look like, where they come from, and what we can do to bridge the gaps between us.\\n\\n## The Big Bang of Moral Views\\n\\nIt\'s almost redundant to say that we often don\'t agree with each other. Disagreement is simply everywhere, just turn on the news, attend a protest, or have dinner with your extended family. This divide seems deeply rooted, we don\'t just disagree about a specific political candidate or policy, it\u2019s the underlying values these things represent that seem so obvious to us. We often think, \\"How could they not see it?\\" or \\"If I just explain it to them, they will surely agree with me.\\"\\n\\nHowever, they usually don\u2019t. It feels like they see the world through a completely different lens. To us, it seems like a distorted one, to them, we are the blind ones. Wherever you look, there\'s a vast spectrum of beliefs. It\'s actually surprising that humanity has made it this far and that we have relatively \\"few\\" violent conflicts nowadays.\\n\\nWithout delving too much into the details, this explosion of diverse moral views began in the last few centuries after the decline of \\"super ideologies\\" that had dictated our way of life and thoughts, such as religion and nationalism. \\"God is dead and we have killed him\\", said Nietzsche, and the question that follows is, \\"What comes next?\\"\\n\\nWith the rise of Individualism, Post-Modernism, and identity politics, we now see a broader range of moral views, partly because they are no longer censored or silenced. People are free to express themselves, and some might feel a need to stand out by developing a slightly different variation of their environment\'s moral beliefs.\\n\\nAs a result, instead of a few ideologies that are imposed upon us (forcefully or subconsciously), we now have a vast spectrum of views on topics like gender, climate change, immigration, and economics.\\n\\nHowever, it isn\u2019t entirely random. This is precisely why we have managed to survive (so far) without a complete societal collapse. We can see correlations between certain views that group us into ideological camps, like liberals and conservatives. Yes, there are many differences within these groups just as there are between them, but they still share some similarities.\\n\\nI argue that these groups form because they are situated near each other on several moral scales, similar to a monochromatic spectrum where all possible outcomes are combinations of the same fundamental colors.\\n\\n## Our Shared Moral Scales\\n\\nWhat are these \\"moral colors\\"? Below are eight scales that represent my interpretation of moral disagreements. Of course, these could vary, you might see six, ten, or different variations of them. But as long as we can agree that some scales exist, we can begin moving in the right direction.\\n\\nIt\u2019s worth noting that a person doesn\u2019t have to occupy the same position on the scale for every topic. On some issues, they may lean toward one extreme, while on others, they may be closer to the opposite end. Also, it\'s unlikely to find someone purely on one end of a spectrum. Since these scales represent values that we all care about, some compromise is expected.\\n\\nAdditionally, these scales are relevant both at the individual and societal levels. As nations often reflect the image of their populations, it is no surprise that moral deliberation on the individual level applies to countries as well.\\n\\n1. **Sanctity vs. Exploration** - This scale reflects how fixed or flexible we consider our values.\\n   - *Sanctity*: Some values are held as sacred, unquestionable truths that must be preserved. Sanctity isn\'t necessarily religious; for example, those who advocate for animal rights may see their suffering as an unquestionable moral concern.\\n   - *Exploration*: Truth is both \\"out there\\" and continuously evolving. To align with it, we must keep exploring, questioning, and adapting our beliefs, holding few or no values as absolute in an ongoing effort to stay aligned with \\"humanity\'s evolving spirit.\\" For example, slavery turned from common practice to taboo because we adjusted our beliefs.\\n\\n2. **Equality vs. Merit** - This scale focuses on the issue of rights and entitlement.\\n   - *Equality*: Rights are inherent to every person by virtue of existence, without any other conditions or justifications. Being human, or a conscious being, is enough to have a moral worth, and these rights should be equal for everyone, regardless of any other criteria.\\n   - *Merit*: People should be judged by their merits, which may mean a different distribution of rights and resources. For instance, individuals might be entitled to the fruits of their labor and creativity, provided everyone has an equal opportunity to demonstrate their worth. It\'s not who we are, but what we do that determines our value.\\n\\n3. **Individuality vs. Community** - This scale addresses who is considered the \\"smallest\\" morally relevant unit and whose well-being is prioritized.\\n   - *Individuality*: The individual is the primary or sole source of value. They are the judge, jury, and executioner of their path to fulfilling their potential. Societal rights are only granted as long as they serve personal interests, and the ultimate goal of society is to make the individual as free as possible.\\n   - *Community*: The community is the main source of value. Humans, as social animals, are subcomponents of the community. Individual rights are granted by the community as long as they serve the greater good, and the ultimate goal is the welfare of the community itself.\\n\\n4. **Security vs. Connectivity** - How much risk are we willing to take for potential benefits?\\n   - *Security*: The primary goal of society is to maintain the safety of its members above all else, treating others with suspicion and building \\"walls\\" (both literal and metaphorical) to separate ourselves from them.\\n   - *Connectivity*: Strength and vulnerability are intertwined and gained by being connected to others. This perspective emphasizes forming complex networks of dependence and cooperation.\\n\\n5. **Destiny vs. Cultivation** - This scale deals with the extent of control we have over our abilities and lives.\\n   - *Destiny*: Many aspects of life are beyond our control, even our beliefs, skills and thoughts are mainly predetermined either from birth or culture. We should acknowledge that and learn to work within our boundaries, to not \\"fight our nature\\", so that we could avoid disappointment, frustration and failure.\\n   - *Cultivation*: Our true potential is not only unknown but also within our power to shape and increase. We are the makers of ourselves, of our identity and our destiny.\\n\\n1. **Permissiveness vs. Dedication** - what is the importance of values and living virtuously?\\n   - *Permissiveness*: Life is about being in the moment and seeking experiences that bring joy and happiness to oneself and perhaps others. We forgive our weaknesses, understanding that to be human is more than living a perfectly virtuous life. It is not just impossible, it\'s highly depressing.\\n   - *Dedication*: We either find or create our purpose in life, a calling that drives us and demands our time, effort, and thought - even at the expense of personal happiness. Abandoning this mission would mean failing ourselves and what we stand for.\\n\\n7. **Redemption vs. Retribution** - How should we respond to those who harm us?\\n   - *Redemption*: \\"Evil\\" may not exist or often stems from ignorance, negligence, circumstances, or miscommunication. In these cases, it\'s not a moral problem, but rather a technical problem that can be solved. Improving the system, like education and welfare can reduce \\"evil\\", and most conflicts can be settled through discussion.\\n   - *Retribution*: True and lasting peace is achieved only when \\"evil doers\\" are deterred by punishment. Evil must be confronted and eradicated, otherwise, unchecked selfish tendencies will lead to corruption, embezzlement, and reduced cooperation and trust.\\n\\n8. **Authority vs. Diversity** - Should there be a hierarchy governing interactions between people?\\n   - *Authority*: Stability and prosperity are achieved when all parts know their place and work together seamlessly, following rules and guidelines that provide clarity and deter deviations.\\n   - *Diversity*: Rules and guidelines are often at odds with the complexity of human experience. Strength and creativity come from a non-hierarchical structure built on a diverse network of voices that share ideas and collaborate without external supervision. The network self-regulates without a clear \\"ruler.\\"\\n## How to Bridge the Gap\\n\\nHopefully, regardless of your political views, you found yourself resonating, at least partially, with both sides of each scale described earlier.\\n\\nIf so, then we are already a step closer to bridging the gap between different viewpoints. Recognizing that both sides of a debate have worthy values means that it\'s all about prioritizing values, rather than claming that some values are \\"wrong\\". Once we understand that, we find more common ground with those on the \\"other side.\\" It\u2019s not that they believe in something entirely different or that they \\"don\u2019t see the truth\\"; rather, they assign different weights to the same values and choose to prioritize one over the other.\\n\\nThis is what it means to hold values in a world with limited time, resources, and capabilities. Consider the choice between helping the poor and improving healthcare. Ideally, we would do both and wish for everyone to be better off, but real life often forces us to make tough choices.\\n\\nIt\'s in these moments, when we must prioritize one value over another, that we truly actualize our values. It\u2019s not about blindly sticking to a value but rather assessing its relevance and importance in each decision and weighing it accordingly. The same value doesn\'t have to always take precedence. Sometimes equality matters more, and other times, merit does.\\n\\nUnderstanding this doesn\u2019t solve all the world\u2019s conflicts. Disagreements will continue to arise, but if we can at least stop demonizing the \\"other side,\\" we can come closer to understanding and compromising. After all, we aren\'t made of different things, just different combinations of the same foundational elements, and that\u2019s something we can work with.\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nWhat might seem like completely different worldviews are, at their core, simply different prioritizations of the same fundamental values. Each value is \\"paired\\" with another, creating a dynamic where, in this world of scarcity, we are often forced to compromise between them. However, regardless of where we find ourselves on these moral scales, we can recognize that those we disagree with also care about the same values we do, they just prioritize them differently.\\n\\nUnderstanding this shifts the perspective from seeing others as \\"demons\\" with opposing values to viewing them as neighbors with different value weights. While this realization won\'t solve all of our conflicts, it does bring us one step closer to finding common ground and engaging in meaningful deliberation rather than confrontation.\\n\\n## Further Reading\\nThe Righteous Mind (book)"},{"id":"enemies-into-allies","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/enemies-into-allies","source":"@site/blog/from-enemies-to-allies-insight.md","title":"From Enemies to Allies","description":"What if the person on the other side isn\u2019t the problem at all?","date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Communication","permalink":"/blog/tags/communication","description":"Understanding and improving communication skills"},{"inline":false,"label":"Cooperation","permalink":"/blog/tags/cooperation","description":"Working together for a common goal"},{"inline":false,"label":"Mindset","permalink":"/blog/tags/mindset","description":"Developing a positive mindset"}],"readingTime":3.85,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20250308181044,"Created":"2025-03-08 18:10","Modified":"2025-03-15 10:05","tags":["communication","cooperation","mindset"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"Viewing disagreements as a shared problem rather than blaming is key to solving them","ContentStatus":"Published","Version":1.01,"aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"enemies-into-allies","date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Morality is like Colors","permalink":"/blog/morality-is-like-colors"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why I\'m (still) an Optimist","permalink":"/blog/why-im-an-optimist"}},"content":"**What if the person on the other side isn\u2019t the problem at all?**  \\nConflicts are inevitable, but how we handle them makes all the difference.

This post explores how shifting our mindset can turn confrontation into collaboration.\\n\\n![from_enemies_to_allies.webp](/posts/from_enemies_to_allies.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## How (not) to Handle a Conflict\\n\\nWe want our relationships to be smooth, pleasurable experiences.\\n\\nWe hope that each will reach a level of synergy and understanding that goes beyond words.\\n\\nYet, as with all relationships, conflicts will happen. Your boss is angry about missing a deadline, your kid doesn\'t listen to you (for the thousandth time), your friends say something hurtful, and your partner doesn\'t do their share of the chores.\\n\\nConflicts are unavoidable, the question is how to approach them.\\n\\nThe unfortunate default response is to be filled with anger, disappointment and resentment. We feel as if we \\"can\'t help it\\", as if it\'s our body\'s automated response. Through red colored glasses, we see the conflict through the \\"blame game\\" eyes.\\n\\nWe say things like \\"why did you do this to me?\\", \\"why do you always do x on purpose?\\", \\"how can you be so inconsiderate?\\".\\n\\nWhen we are on the yelled side, we get defensive, we shift the blame back to the other person, we rebel against their wishes, we yell, we quit, we hide, whatever\'s necessary to protect ourselves. After all, how can we accept being treated that way? Once the fight begins, it\'s no longer admitting to making a mistake, rather that we are a bad or stupid person (or both).\\n\\nThe blame game only ends in one way, the worst way. It turns disagreement into conflict, it escalates, it hurts, and it fails to solve the problem that caused it.\\n\\nWe need to handle conflicts better, or more correctly, not treat them as conflict in the first place.\\n\\n## From Conflict to Cooperation\\n\\nA disagreement becomes a conflict once we see the other person as the problem, instead of the problem as the problem. If our kids doesn\'t listen to us, it\'s because they are lazy, inconsiderate, or selfish.\\n\\nWe attach the problem to their identity, which means the only way the problem will be solved is if they change who they are.\\n\\nInstead, we should see the problem as the problem. What caused the event? Why is there a miscommunication? Perhaps they don\'t understand what you\'re asking, perhaps they want to do it yet fail because of distractions or forgetfulness, perhaps they were having a really bad day so your request should be the last thing on their mind.\\n\\nRemember that most likely, people are not \\"out to get you\\", they hardly do things intentionally to hurt you, even if it seems that way.\\n\\nWhen we shift the perspective from \\"they are the problem\\", to \\"there\'s a problem\\", a whole new range of options opens up that gives a much healthier view on the situation.\\n\\nWhen the other person is not the problem, you turn them from an enemy to an ally.\\n\\nAllies can use their collective intelligence, motivation and energy to solve a shared problem. Being enemies usually only make the problem worse. It\'s a huge difference when the \\"other side\\" works with you, not against you, offering solutions that you might not have thought about.\\n\\nFor example, a criticizing boss doesn\'t mean they are a disagreeable person, rather it\'s a shared communication problem. Having a sync at the start of a project instead of at the end will make sure the plan works for both sides, preventing the criticism in advance, without targeting someone as problematic\\n\\n## Actionable Tips: How to Turn Conflict Into Collaboration\\n- **Pause before reacting** \u2013 Take a breath before assuming the worst.\\n- **Describe the problem** \u2013 Instead of blaming, describe the problem objectively, as something you both face together.\\n- **Use \u201CI\u201D statements** \u2013 Say how the situation affects you rather than accusing. Like \\"I feel that...\\" instead of \\"you always...\\"\\n- **Seek their input** \u2013 Ask them how they view the situation, and which solutions they can offer.\\n- **Look for common ground** \u2013 Focus on shared interests, not differences.\\n## Ask Yourself\\n- How do I typically react to conflict?\\n- Have I ever assumed bad intent when there was none?\\n- How can I better separate the person from their behavior?\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nA disagreement is nothing more than a shared problem, one that we can work together to solve. Turning it into a blame game makes it a conflict, where both sides get hurts and the problem remains unsolved.

But what if the way we see the world changes what we get from it? This post explores how choosing optimism isn\u2019t about ignoring problems\u2014but believing we can overcome them.\\n\\n![why_im_still_an_optimist.webp](/posts/why_im_still_an_optimist.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nIs the glass half full or half empty? Are people inherently good? What will become of our world? Given the wars, epidemics, and political turmoil in recent years, it\'s hard not to lean toward pessimism. In fact, it might even seem realistic to believe that things will probably go wrong.\\n\\nHowever, what we see is what we get. When we choose to view the world through dark-colored glasses, it\'s no surprise that everything suddenly seems more depressing. While we don\u2019t control the world, we do control how we view it, and this choice has a significant impact on how we experience life, others, and our overall well-being.\\n\\nBecoming an optimist can strengthen our relationships with others, improve our happiness, sharpen our minds, and help us solve problems rather than drowning in them. Don\u2019t get me wrong - optimism isn\u2019t about ignoring our problems. It\u2019s about having the conviction that we can overcome them and knowing that even when new problems arise (and they will), they won\u2019t stop us from becoming who we can be and believing that we can make things better.\\n\\nSo, let\'s happily dive in.\\n\\n## Optimism to the Rescue\\n\\nWhile we can relate the optimist/pessimist dilemma to how we view the world, the most important question is how we view *our* world - what happens to us personally (who wouldn\'t agree that we matter most?).\\n\\nMore specifically, the question is how we perceive supposedly negative things that happen to us and the challenges we face. We often revert to becoming the victim, thinking, \\"Why did this happen to me?\\" or \\"How will I ever overcome this?\\" We feel powerless, hopeless, and angry at the world, as if a huge rock hangs above our heads or walls surround us, threatening to crush us. Worst of all, even if there are some good things that come along with it, we become completely blind to them or dismiss them because they clash with our \\"victim narrative.\\"\\n\\nThe biggest, hardest, and most meaningful change we can make is to realize that events are neither good nor bad - we make them so. This doesn\'t mean we are indifferent to them; we would never be indifferent between losing a loved one and winning the lottery. Nor does it mean we won\'t experience negative emotions like anger or sadness. Unpleasant things will happen, and pain will come, but what we choose to do about it is entirely within our control.\\n\\nWhen we understand that our reaction is completely in our hands, that we are always free to choose how to respond, we realize the power we have over any situation. We can transform obstacles into stepping stones, using these obstacles as opportunities to grow, learn, and become better.\\n\\nThose who choose to drown in misery are consumed by it and become slaves to it. Their mental and physical health weakens, they remain stagnant, and they focus on failure, unable to see a way out. However, when we choose to see the usefulness in these obstacles, when we see a chance to rise above them, we are most likely able to. It\'s fake it till you make it all the way to the top. We acknowledge that having challenges is what helps us grow - a do-or-die moment from which we emerge stronger and better.\\n\\nI had a personal experience where I was completely isolated from my friends and family, forced to participate in activities that went against the core of my being, and lived in almost inhumane conditions. Was it a pleasant experience? Would I want something like that to happen to me again? Absolutely not. I experienced pain and suffering. But did I gain something from it? Definitely. I had a lot of time to reflect on my life, who I am, and what I believe in. Those harsh conditions stretched the limits of what I thought I could endure. I survived and returned stronger and more confident in myself, and for that, I am grateful. I chose to focus on the positive side of it all, rather than be consumed by sadness.\\n\\n## Can there Be Too much of a Good Thing?\\n\\nBeing too optimistic can be a bad thing. If we start seeing everything through rose-tinted glasses, we might miss out on some red flags. Thinking \\"there\'s good in every bad\\" might make us less risk-averse than we should be, causing us not to take the necessary precautions or to neglect developing our capabilities such that those negative things would be avoided in the first place. We become less inquisitive, less informed about potential hazards, and overconfident without the knowledge to back it up.\\n\\nWhen optimism turns into wishful thinking or daydreaming without being balanced with a touch of realism, we might become careless about what happens to us, believing that \\"things will work out in the end,\\" and forgetting the important distinction between what\'s within our power to change and our obligation to act on it.\\n\\nSo, why not just be a realist? Realists seem to have the best of both worlds: seeing the world \\"as it truly is\\" without judgment, trying to look only at the facts, and working with what they have. While it sounds promising, I think that being a realist is a false hope for two main reasons:\\n\\n1. **We are never without our glasses** - There is a long history of debate on whether we can ever truly remove our mental lenses through which we see the world - even down to perceiving simple details like shape or color. It\'s unclear if attempting to see the complex world of human interaction in its raw form, without Narratives or judgment, is worthwhile, let alone possible. Most likely, those who claim neutrality are more delusional than accurate.\\n2. **We are bad at prediction** - Even if we could separate facts from opinions and look at the cold, hard reality, what does it tell us about the future? Unfortunately, humans are notoriously bad at making guesses, even educated ones. Political experts are mistaken more often than not, and even those who get it right are likely to fail on their next guess. Just look at how much data and complex math is required to create basic computer models to forecast the future - and even then, it\'s \\"approximately almost right.\\" Therefore, just knowing the facts is not enough, since the future is still blurry. We are not exempt from making judgments that inherently involve values, beliefs, and biases.\\n\\n## Cultivating Balanced Optimism\\n\\nIt seems that to maintain a healthy level of optimism, we need to balance two extremes: \\"acknowledging the hardships of the world\\" and \\"noticing and reframing reality in a more positive, protective way.\\"\\n\\nSo, how can we do both of these things?\\n\\nHow to Cultivate Realism:\\n1. **Practice mindfulness** - Try to quiet your mind and reflect on your thoughts, senses, and the world around you without any judgments or filters. Mindfulness helps you observe reality as it is, not as you wish it to be.\\n2. **Draw Your Circle of Control** - Consider what you are capable of controlling in your life and what is beyond your control. For instance, you always have the freedom to choose how to react, how to use your spare time, and which commitments are still worth following. On the other hand, recognize that you don\u2019t control the state of the economy, events of random luck, or how others choose to act.\\n\\nHow to Cultivate Optimism:\\n1. **Believe in Yourself** - Embrace a growth mindset, trusting that you can change and grow. Avoid harsh self-criticism and practice self-compassion, recognizing that everyone makes mistakes and that they are opportunities for growth.\\n2. **Express gratitude** - Reflect daily on what you are grateful for. These can be small things, such as enjoying a warm meal, having a pleasant conversation with a friend, or witnessing a beautiful sunrise.\\n3. **Be Kind** - Make an effort to perform small acts of kindness each day. This could be as simple as holding the door for someone, helping a colleague at work, or doing something thoughtful for your partner or family.\\n4. **Reframe Challenges** - Focus on how the challenges in your life can help you grow. Consider what you can learn from them, viewing them as opportunities to practice your skills, like a workout for the mind. Embrace them not just as a natural part of life, but as a necessary step to becoming a stronger, more resilient person.\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBeing an optimist is more than just seeing the glass as half full, it\'s about finding a tap and filling it completely. It\'s not about ignoring the half-empty side but rather taking action to address it, facing challenges head-on.\\n\\nBeing an optimist is a choice - one of the best choices we can make. It involves surrounding ourselves with positivity in the most protective way, believing in our power and the power of others to bring goodness into the world, while still acknowledging all the flaws and faults that exist.

Sometimes it feels that admitting our mistakes is even worse than the mistake itself.\\n\\nPerhaps we have failed to notice that we made a mistake, or that we hope we can fix it before anyone else can see, but when we admit it we turn in into reality, it becomes common knowledge.\\n\\nAll of our faults, our imperfection and our \\"ugly sides\\" are now publicly displayed for everyone to see. It feels like an indication that we have failed as people, that not only our actions, but our identity is hurt, lacking, weak.\\n\\nI was (and somewhat still am) afraid of admitting I\'m wrong. Whenever I get criticized, I immediately go into defensive mode. I deny, I redirect, I rage, because I feel that to listen and agree is a proof of my low worth. Although, deep inside, I now that these reactions are strong precisely because the feedback is true, that I have failed, as if by denying it I can change reality.\\n\\n## The Hidden Cost of Denial\\n\\nWhile denying our mistakes makes us feel better on the short term, it\'s harmful in the long run.\\n\\nWe prioritize our Ego over our growth.\\n\\nIt means that instead of addressing these mistakes head on, we ignore them, which is a sure recipe of repeating them. It gets worse if on top of denying them we blame someone or something else, because this hurts not just our ability to deal with these specific mistakes, but also cultivates a mindset of helplessness, as if there was nothing you could have done differently, as if we are always right and perfect, and it is others who set us back.\\n\\nIronically, by ignoring our mistakes we turn them from momentary errors to a permanent stain on our identity. We hide them because we fear we are truly worthless, incompetent. We give them power over our lives, over our identity.\\n\\nRemoving their power is through taking ownership and accountability, by admitting them we show others that we are honest, that we can do better, that we wish to be better, that we don\'t let these moments define us, and that we take responsibility over our actions, our behavior, and not dismiss it or blame others when it\'s convenient.\\n\\nIdentifying with our mistakes is the best way to overcome them.\\n\\n## Actionable Tips: How to Embrace Your Mistakes\\n- **Pause & Reflect** \u2013 When faced with criticism, instead of reacting defensively, take a moment to listen. Recognize that they are trying to help you, that they criticize the action, not your identity.\\n- **Reframe Failure** \u2013 See mistakes as learning opportunities, not personal failures. Mistakes are valuable lessons, ones that we can learn only by examining them.\\n- **Ask for Feedback** \u2013 Don\'t run away from feedback, embrace it. Constant feedback has preventative qualities, providing insights that will reduce the number and the degree of our mistakes.\\n- **Be future oriented** \u2013 Analyze your mistakes in a forward looking way, focus on what you can do better next time.\\n\\n## The Takeaway: The Power of Owning Your Mistakes\\n\\nSaying \\"I was wrong\\" is a liberating experience. By taking ownership over our mistakes, we are able to overcome them. There is nothing to be ashamed of, it is a proof of character, rather than a stain on one, to admit that we were wrong.\\n\\nAs with failures in general, they are the stepping stones for our improvement, we try, we fail, we learn, to try to live without error is like trying to be the best painter in the world without ever holding a brush. Improving and failing are two sides of the same coin.\\n\\nSo be proud, that you had the courage to try, the courage to step out of your comfort zone, and the courage to own your mistakes.\\n\\n## Ask Yourself\\n- When was the last time I admitted I was wrong?\\n- How do I feel about myself when I make a mistake?\\n- How do I handle mistakes? Is there a learning process afterwards?"},{"id":"chaos-into-momentum","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/chaos-into-momentum","source":"@site/blog/emotional-aikido---turn-chaos-into-momentum-synthesis-book.md","title":"Emotional Aikido - Turn Chaos into Momentum","description":"Do you ever feel like you\'re fighting with yourself?","date":"2025-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Motivation","permalink":"/blog/tags/motivation","description":"Finding and maintaining motivation in your life"},{"inline":false,"label":"Emotions","permalink":"/blog/tags/emotions","description":"Understanding and managing your emotions"}],"readingTime":10.04,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20230329173441,"Created":"2023-03-29 17:34","Modified":"2025-02-02 06:36","tags":["motivation","emotions"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"Live would be much easier, successful, and peaceful when we work with our emotions instead of against them","ContentStatus":"Published","Version":1.01,"aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"chaos-into-momentum","date":"2025-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Admitting Our Faults","permalink":"/blog/Admitting-out-faults"},"nextItem":{"title":"Say Yes To Less","permalink":"/blog/say-yes-to-less"}},"content":"**Do you ever feel like you\'re fighting with yourself?**  \\nThat inner conflict between your rational goals and emotional impulses might be holding you back more than you realize. In this post, we explore how bridging that internal divide can lead to clarity, energy, and real progress, without the burnout or guilt.\\n\\n![emotional_aikido_post.webp](/posts/emotional_aikido_post.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## Introduction\\n\\nWe have all faced struggles in our lives, especially internal ones. It\'s as if we are made up of two distinct selves: the \\"Rational \\" side that strives for action without excuses, and the \\"emotional\\" side that prefers the easier, more enjoyable path.\\n\\nWhile we strongly feel these two separates sides and how often they clash, by viewing ourselves this way we are setting ourselves up for failure. This false dichotomy often leads us to ruin, whether through apathy, self-hatred, or losing track of what matters most. When we leave ourselves divided, we fail to benefit from the energy and determination of a unified whole, like trying to use bikes without handles, or alternatively a bike with no wheels. We need both to prosper.\\n\\nToday we\'ll discuss how to do just that, and I hope you\'ve got your sweatshirts and headbands ready because I like to call this method *Emotional Aikido*. But first let\'s explain why each side is insufficient on its own, and how can we bring these two parts together.\\n\\n## Why Can\'t I just \\"power through\\"\\n*\\"Tomorrow I\'ll do better.\\"* Famous first, and often last, words of many commitments. Unfortunately, most end up repeating the same negative routines. It could be going to the gym, starting that healthy diet, or calling friends and family. More often than not, these promises go unfulfilled.\\n\\nIn modern times, perhaps since the great scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, we\'ve placed too much trust in our brains. We believe that \\"if there is a will, there is a way,\\" only to end up on the same path as before. What we need to understand is that Willpower is Limited, and relying solely on \\"powering through\\" to achieve our goals is not only ineffective or delusional but can also be harmful.\\n\\nWe tend to believe that willpower works like this:\\n1. **Motivation** - We start with motivation, perhaps sparked by a strong desire to change something in our lives.\\n2. **Action** - We begin to take action, aligning with our goals, and we feel as if it will be smooth sailing from now on.\\n3. **Change** - We start seeing changes resulting from these actions and embrace them wholeheartedly.\\n\\nHowever, this model is misleading, and our life experiences may have already shown us that it\'s not as simple as it seems.\\n\\nA more accurate representation of reality involves understanding that change is not always a guaranteed outcome when relying on rationality alone. Moreover, there are two infinite loops we can easily get trapped in if we aren\'t careful: the loops of apathy and Procrastination. I call them the \\"why even try\\" and \\"why not tomorrow\\" cycles. Once we enter these loops, they can be incredibly difficult to escape.\\n\\nTherefore, the first step is to understand what causes us to fall into these loops in the first place.\\n\\n### Why even Try?\\n\\nWe often end up discouraged after a failure, which is almost inevitable. Maybe you accidentally skip a workout, the healthy diet isn\'t showing results, or you\'ve had a rough day and just can\'t muster the strength to follow through. When these setbacks happen once or twice, we might be able to push through and reignite our motivation to start again. However, each failure can feel like a tiny puncture in a wheel; eventually, there\'s no air left to keep going. Instead of starting again, we simply give up. The world starts to look like a pessimistic and deterministic place, where failure seems predestined, so there\'s no point in even trying.\\n\\nEscaping this cycle is challenging because it requires us to \\"forget\\" the lessons we\'ve learned the hard way and take a leap and try again. Even when every fiber of our being tells us it\'s foolish to attempt something that can only lead to disappointment.\\n\\nWhether fueled by anger at the world, anger at ourselves, or both, falling into this pit of despair makes it incredibly difficult to climb back out.\\n\\n### Why not Tomorrow\\n\\nA second infinite cycle, perhaps more elusive than the first, is the cycle of procrastination, the \\"why not tomorrow\\" loop. After all, you can\'t fail if you never try. Unlike the first cycle, it\u2019s not that we lack motivation, we might even be genuinely optimistic about how our lives could improve when we will start to act differently. The problem is that \\"now is not the right time.\\"\\n\\nThe fear of Failure pushes us to set the bar so high for what we consider success that it becomes nearly unattainable. For example, what\'s the point of working out for just 20 minutes a week if a \\"good\\" workout must last at least 45 minutes? And since I don\'t have that much time right now, it\'s better not to do it at all. Or perhaps, we think that we are not yet worthy, for example who am I to write a blog post about productivity? I should read and study more until I\'m absolutely certain I\'m an expert on the topic. Until then, I won\u2019t write a single word!\\n\\nIf in the previous example, each failure was like a puncture in our tires, then here, we won\'t even start the car unless we have complete information about the road conditions, the state of the car, and are 100% certain we\u2019ll reach our destination.\\n\\n## Why Can\'t I just Do it when I Feel like it\\n\\nJust like with the rational side, there\u2019s also the emotional side. Whether due to personal tastes, beliefs, or disappointment with rational approaches, we may shift to a mindset that relies on our internal world of emotions and sensations as the source of our actions, rather than cold, rational decision-making.\\n\\nFor instance, we might believe that life is like a flowing river that shouldn\u2019t be controlled. Perhaps we realize that our disappointment with the rational approach stems from something within us resisting the change, so we decide to listen to our feelings, to our body, and do what feels right.\\n\\nThis might sound similar to the \\"why not tomorrow\\" case, but the difference is that in that scenario, the desire was for complete control and knowledge before taking action. Here, it\u2019s not about control but rather motivation. The driver isn\u2019t concerned with the car or the road, they are simply not sure if they want to drive at all. Unlike the \\"why even try\\" scenario, it\u2019s not that we believe it\u2019s doomed from the start, we might even think that if we truly wanted to, we could succeed, we\u2019re just not sure if we want to, or prefer to leave things to nature, fate or chance instead of being the driver ourselves.\\n\\nSo, what\u2019s wrong with this approach? Relying solely on internal feelings can lead to:\\n\\n4. **Inconsistency** - Even with habits that feel most natural to us, we don\u2019t always find the Intrinsic Motivation to stick with them. If we only act when we feel like it, our actions are likely to be inconsistent, which won\'t help us achieve our goals. For example, working out once a month is unlikely to yield the desired results.\\n5. **Imbalance** - On the other hand, we can sometimes get so caught up in what we\'re doing that we forget everything else. This sense of Flow is often a good thing, but without knowing when to stop, it can lead to extreme outcomes, such as becoming a workaholic or developing a \\"one-track mind.\\"\\n6. **Misalignment** - Not everything that feels good is necessarily good for us. Unfortunately, nearly everything, from food to mass media, has been engineered to affect us emotionally. If we use our biological tendencies as guides, we can sometimes be led astray by our emotions.\\n\\n## The Solution? Emotional Aikido\\n\\nThis is just one tool in our overarching plan to achieve balance. The main idea is simple: instead of fighting against yourself, work with yourself to achieve better results.\\n\\nBut why call it \\"emotional aikido\\"? Aikido is a Japanese martial art often translated as \\"the path of harmony,\\" where you act to preserve not only yourself but also your opponent, discouraging violence and aggression. The way to achieve this is by using your opponent\'s momentum against them.\\n\\nAn easy example: if an opponent is running at you, you can either stand your ground and fight, or step aside and trip them. In doing so, you use all their energy and momentum against them, turning their attack into their downfall.\\n\\nSo how does this apply to our topic? The answer is perhaps simple to understand yet harder to implement: as with most things, the answer lies in the middle. Yes, we need to listen to our body and emotions when we act. Trying to \\"push through\\" and force ourselves to do something we don\u2019t truly want is a waste of time. However, acting solely based on feelings lacks the structure, direction, and consistency provided by a rational approach.\\n\\nSo, how do we connect these two parts?\\n\\n7. **Know Thyself** - Regularly perform self-checks, asking yourself how you feel in the moment and noticing patterns that arise. For instance, maybe you avoid working out because you\'re ashamed of how you look, or your motivation for writing comes from a desire to support others and help them learn from your mistakes.\\n8. **Plan with the Heart in Mind** - Now that we know what makes us tick, we can find ways to motivate ourselves without relying on sheer willpower. Techniques like Temptation Bundling, priming your environment, and motivational scheduling are just a few examples. If we plan this way, we may slowly see ourselves beginning to enjoy doing what is good, and those hard actions suddenly become easier.\\n9. **Convert Failure to Fuel** - A common saying in Stoicism is that good or bad is a result of internal judgment, independent of external events. While this may not apply to every situation, we can certainly adopt this mindset regarding failure. By seeing failures as opportunities to learn and grow rather than as a mark of shame, we can completely shift our motivation. Failure means you\u2019re not there yet, not that you can\'t get there. Sometimes, failure contains the lessons needed to ensure we don\u2019t repeat it and achieve Mastery, provided we spend enough time listening to it. We are not defined by our failures, but by how we respond to them.\\n\\nIf instead of fighting ourselves, we listen,\\nif instead of making it hard, we make it easy,\\nif instead of getting angry, we get excited,\\nthen we have mastered emotional aikido.\\n\\nOur emotions, even the \\"bad ones\\" and perhaps especially the bad ones, such as jealously, envy, anger and frustration are the greatest source of fuel we have. Rather than being denied or ignored, they should be embraced. They are like a storm brewing with us, waiting for something to strike. It is the rational side\'s job to funnel that immense energy to a positive outlet, to ride that storm until we reach our destination. Fuel and direction, emotion and rationality, we need them both.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nWe\'ve explored two models of thinking-to-action: one based on rationality and the other on emotionality. Each, when used in isolation, has its pitfalls:\\n\\n- **Rationality without emotions** leads to burnout, self-hatred, and procrastination.\\n- **Emotions without rationality** result in inconsistency, misalignment, and imbalance.\\n\\nBut when combined, these two approaches create a powerful synergy that is greater than the sum of its parts. The rational side offers direction and structure, while the emotional side provides the fuel. By merging them, you can work smart, not hard. And as a bonus, this blend not only enhances productivity but also fosters balance and well-being in life. \uD83D\uDE0A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Further Reading:\\nEgo Is The Enemy (book)\\nThe Obstacle Is the Way (book)\\nMindset (book)\\nFlow (book)"},{"id":"say-yes-to-less","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/say-yes-to-less","source":"@site/blog/say-yes-to-less-insight.md","title":"Say Yes To Less","description":"Feeling overwhelmed and falling short on all fronts?","date":"2025-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Focus","permalink":"/blog/tags/focus","description":"Improving concentration and focus in your life"},{"inline":false,"label":"Minimalism","permalink":"/blog/tags/minimalism","description":"Simplifying your life and decluttering your mind"},{"inline":false,"label":"Reflection","permalink":"/blog/tags/reflection","description":"Reflect on your life, your decisions, and your future"}],"readingTime":3.08,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20241123082014,"Created":"2024-11-23 08:20","Modified":"2024-11-23 08:20","Version":1,"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"By narrowing our scope we can accomplish more","tags":["focus","minimalism","reflection"],"ContentStatus":"Published","aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"say-yes-to-less","date":"2025-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Emotional Aikido - Turn Chaos into Momentum","permalink":"/blog/chaos-into-momentum"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to remember who we are","permalink":"/blog/how-to-remember-who-we-are"}},"content":"**Feeling overwhelmed and falling short on all fronts?**  \\nWhen everything feels urgent, nothing truly moves forward. This post dives into why doing less strategically can help you do more of what really matters. Let go of guilt, cut the noise, and focus your energy where it counts.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Overwhelm and Overcommitment\\n\\nWhat are you planning to do after reading this? Perhaps you need to work, get groceries, handle some bureaucracy, help a friend, pursue personal goals, fix that thing that\u2019s been broken for weeks, or maybe even all of the above. Especially now when a new year has just started and promises of \\"new year new me\\" have been pilling up, it\u2019s no wonder we often feel overwhelmed, like there just aren\u2019t enough hours in the day. Even if the days were twice as long, it might still not feel like enough to clear our endless to-do lists.\\n\\nThe commitments we juggle - to ourselves, to friends, to our partners, and to the lifestyles we aspire to create - can easily become overwhelming. This constant pressure leaves us frustrated or, worse, guilty for failing to meet our own expectations and those of others. The feeling of not doing enough, of not being enough, becomes an ever-present shadow.\\n\\n### Do Less to Achieve More\\n\\nThe truth is simple and unavoidable: there will never be enough time. As long as we fail to set boundaries and say no, we\u2019ll remain trapped in the cycle of trying to do it all. And while doing it all might sound admirable, in reality, \u201Call\u201D includes both the significant and the trivial. Our time is limited, we must learn to be selective.\\n\\nSaying no is about more than refusing requests - it\u2019s about choosing what to focus on. Saying yes to less allows us to devote our energy to what truly matters, making meaningful progress on priorities instead of getting stuck in the endless churn of busyness. By doing less, we can ultimately achieve more.\\n\\nSaying no is hard, especially to ourselves. Our dreams are endless and our time so limited, but this is precisely why we need to narrow down, to prioritize what we spend time on, and have the strength to say no to the trivial. When you know what\'s important to you and why, it\'s easier to say no to the rest. \\n\\n### Actionable Tips to Simplify and Prioritize\\n\\n1. **Audit your commitments:**\\n\\t1. Make a list of everything currently on your plate. Identify which commitments align with your core values and goals.\\n\\t2. Highlight tasks that can be postponed, delegated, or removed entirely.\\n2. **Set boundaries:**\\n\\t1. Practice saying \\"no\\" to new commitments that don\u2019t align with your priorities.\\n\\t2. Communicate openly with others about adjusting expectations to manage your workload realistically.\\n3. **Focus deeply:**\\n    1. Choose one or two high-priority tasks to focus on each day. Channel your energy into these instead of spreading yourself thin.\\n4. **Let go of guilt:**\\n    1. Remind yourself that doing less is not failure - it\u2019s a strategic choice to dedicate your best efforts to what truly matters.\\n\\n### The Takeaway\\n\\nFeeling overwhelmed isn\u2019t a sign of weakness - it\u2019s a signal to reassess and refocus. By doing less, you can free yourself from guilt, make meaningful progress, and give your best to the commitments that matter most.\\n\\n### Ask yourself \\n\\n1. Imagine your life from scratch, commitment free. How would you feel? How will it be different?\\n2. Now when the slate is clean. Which commitments on your plate are the most meaningful to you?\\n3. What\u2019s one promise or task you can let go of?\\n4. What\u2019s one area of your life where you could set clearer boundaries to protect your time and energy?"},{"id":"how-to-remember-who-we-are","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-remember-who-we-are","source":"@site/blog/how-to-remember-who-we-are-synthesis.md","title":"How to remember who we are","description":"Ever feel like you\'re losing sight of who you are?","date":"2025-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Writing","permalink":"/blog/tags/writing","description":"The art and craft of writing"},{"inline":false,"label":"Personal-Identity","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal-identity","description":"Who are you?

Here\'s why making it a habit can save you from future identity crises.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Confused? So am I\\n\\nHave you ever found yourself suddenly \\"awake\\", as if you have been on autopilot, not sure what just happened? This \\"awakening\\" can be as little as \\"how did I get here\\" moments or \\"what was I just doing\\" and as large as an existential crisis such as \\"what I am doing with my life\\".\\n\\nWe humans are naturally curious; we tend to seek causality, even when it isn\'t really there. These questions pop up once in a while from our subconscious, reminding us that there are some unresolved thoughts or feelings, some voice inside us that tries to bring us back on track. The \\"bigger\\" the question, the harder it is to resolve. \\n\\nLife, especially on autopilot, is like playing a game of \\"musical chairs in a kitchen\\". Imagine a group of people, where each person has only 15 minutes to cook something before they have to switch with someone else, leaving no instructions or clues. You could imagine our quickly it can turn into a disaster. In life, it is if every moment a new \\"us\\" enters the picture, trying to make sense of what has happened before, and what can we do now. These moments are confusion are exactly when we have failed to put the pieces of our lives together, that we can\'t connect anymore to our unifying narrative, if we even have one. In our cooking example, we might choose to start over, throwing away past investments to the trash, or going with the flow and creating something edible at best. \\n\\nImagine the same scenario, but this time all the cooks had a shared recipe, and they could leave a note to each other before they switch. Instead of a mess in the kitchen, we would probably get a decent meal.\\n\\nThe same can be done in our personal lives. We often expect too much of ourselves, that we would be able to remember everything in our minds, despite quickly losing focus and forgetting, even things as important as our identity, our values, our goals and what brings us meaning in life. \\n\\nWe are not a goldfish, but not a computer either, and even these can be overloaded and crash. To prevent this crisis from happen we need to offload, to have a record of our thoughts, our identity, to help us remember the most important things exactly when we need to. While offloading may sound like we let something external take control of us, it\'s exactly the opposite. It will be our words, our thoughts, our time capsules of identities that will echo back to us.\\n\\nJournaling is a simple yet profound solution, with three main advantages:\\n1. Remembering the past\\n2. Understanding the present\\n3. Planning for the future\\n\\n## Remembering the past\\n\\nWe now live in a world where we have to navigate the constant, endless sea of content on own own, while everyone else is vying for our  attention (or our wallet\'s) for as much as possible.\\n\\nIn this Pavlovian world of notifications, it\u2019s no wonder that we can only concentrate for a few minutes before feeling the urge to switch to something else. This often leads to three unfortunate outcomes:\\n\\n1. **The important is forgotten** - We tend to forget things a lot. It could be birthdays, tasks that need to be completed, or, most importantly, our most valuable moments. Time spent with friends and family, unique experiences, or even just enjoying the little things in life. Whether because we aren\'t fully present physically or mentally, those moments tend to drift away if we don\'t pay attention.\\n\\n2. **Change is unnoticeable** - Without a clear record of our mental state at different times, we might assume that we\'ve always believed what we believe today, that we share values, thoughts, and feelings with our past selves. Habits deeply entrenched in our minds feel as if they have always been there. The present is hard enough to process through our current lens, so imagining what our past self would have thought is practically impossible.\\n\\n3. **Value requires reflection** - We don\'t always appreciate what we have or experience the first time around. Sometimes it takes years for the importance to sink in and change us forever. If the message is lost before we reach that stage, we will never be able to benefit from this understanding.\\n\\n## Understanding the Present\\n\\nWhen we are bombarded with so much information vying for our attention, it is not surprising if we fail to notice the more subtle cues that hide in plain sight, since not everything worth saying is necessarily being told.\\n\\nThere\'s a famous story about a policeman who sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what he has lost. The man says he lost his keys, and they both search under the streetlight together. After a few minutes, the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them there, and the drunk replies no, that he lost them in the park. When the policeman asks why he\'s searching under the streetlight, the drunk replies, \\"this is where the light is.\\"\\n\\nIf we focus only on what we \\"see,\\" we will likely miss the important things that are a bit harder to perceive. For example, we can\'t see into the minds of others. Sometimes we are not necessarily aware of our own thoughts, so how could we know what others are thinking? Instead of asking others to be more transparent, we default to making false assumptions. And you know what they say about those who assume... To make things worse, we also have the tendency to assume the worst.\\nIf someone does something wrong, we assume it was intentional, if they fail to do something good, we assume it\'s because they don\'t care.\\n\\nAnother common false assumption is thinking that others see the world the same way we do, whether it\u2019s due to shared information, beliefs, or values. A well known experiment tests children by placing them in a room with an adult who hides an object in Box A. The adult then leaves the room, and the experimenter moves the object from Box A to Box B. The child is asked where the adult will search for the object when they return. Those who answer B do not realize their knowledge is not \\"automatically\\" shared with everyone.\\n\\nIt might seem easy to outsmart this (after all, it\u2019s a children\u2019s test), but adults fail too. For example, I might expect something from my partner simply because \\"I thought I told you about it,\\" or because \\"I thought you knew me well enough that it goes without saying.\\" These cases often end in arguments caused by miscommunication that could have been easily resolved.\\n\\nLastly, it might not be others we are failing to understand, but the situation as a whole. We often lack Context, which usually requires remembering what has happened before and why (do you remember the previous chapter?). Focusing only on what\'s in front of us without context could cause us to miss the meaning of what we\'re doing. For example, going to the gym without remembering how you felt afterward or the sense of satisfaction when you weigh yourself each weekend could easily make you lose interest in going again. Similarly, small incremental changes might be too minor to notice daily, but looking back over a month or a year can make them much more noticeable. For example, reading just 10 pages a day sounds insignificant, but it adds up to a book a month, which is actually quite a lot.\\n\\n## Preparing for the Future\\n\\nA famous quote says, \\"Those who don\'t learn from history are bound to repeat it.\\" While not all learning is writing (although some might argue otherwise), writing things down significantly increases the likelihood that we will remember them. By documenting our thoughts - what we did well, what went wrong, we\'re much more likely to internalize those lessons and act differently in the future.\\n\\nBuilding on this, writing can help us detect patterns. When we develop a habit of writing regularly, we are more likely to notice recurring behaviors over time. As imperfect humans, we might make the same mistake twice or even a third time. In such cases, writing can help us identify these patterns, provide a stable source of learning, and serve as a foundation for possible solutions. For example, if we jot down all the instances where we failed to stick to our routines, it might prompt us to think about why that is. Perhaps it\'s because a part of us resists it, or maybe we just need to plan better to align with our motivation.\\n\\nHowever, merely writing without reviewing what we\'ve written is similar to hoping we can remember everything without any aid - but that\u2019s a topic for another post.\\n\\n## So how do we start?\\n\\nThe good thing about journaling is that it\'s personal. You decide when and how to write, and about what. Journaling is a practice that helps even if we never read again what we\'ve written. The act itself of writing reengages us with our thoughts, turning the mess in our mind into a clear narrative. \\n\\nYou could start with morning pages, where you write as soon as you wake up 1-3 pages of whatever you like. You can try bullet journaling, daily reviews, weekly reviews, carrying a small notepad and writing thoughts as they come up. Try, try different methods and see what resonates with you, and see what helps you remember the past, understanding the present, and planning for the future.\\n\\nIt might be weird at first, staring at a blank page and starting a written conversation with... yourself? But you never know, you might like it, and someday, it might even get published:)\\n\\n## Further Reading\\nIt wasn\'t the main message of any one book, but some books reference it\\nHow to think like a roman emperor (book)\\nFirst Things First (book)\\nThe 12 week year (book)"},{"id":"taking-control-of-your-attention","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/taking-control-of-your-attention","source":"@site/blog/taking-control-of-your-attention-insight.md","title":"Taking Control of Your Attention","description":"Are you living intentionally\u2014=, or just reacting to the noise around you?","date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Focus","permalink":"/blog/tags/focus","description":"Improving concentration and focus in your life"},{"inline":false,"label":"Reflection","permalink":"/blog/tags/reflection","description":"Reflect on your life, your decisions, and your future"}],"readingTime":2.8,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20241123081050,"Created":"2024-11-23 08:10","Modified":"2024-11-23 08:10","Version":1,"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"How to pause and reflect to avoid falling into defaults","tags":["focus","reflection"],"ContentStatus":"Published","aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"taking-control-of-your-attention","date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to remember who we are","permalink":"/blog/how-to-remember-who-we-are"},"nextItem":{"title":"Turn pain into growth","permalink":"/blog/turn-pain-into-growth"}},"content":"**Are you living intentionally\u2014=, or just reacting to the noise around you?**  \\nIn a world full of distractions, it\'s easy to slip into autopilot. But real change starts when we pause, reflect, and choose our path with clarity. Here\'s how to reclaim your focus and take back control.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### The rarest commodity: undivided attention \\n\\nWhen was the last time you were fully immersed in a single task, completely \\"in the zone\\"? If this happens often for you, you\u2019re among a rare group, and the rest of us could certainly use your advice! Reaching this state of flow is incredibly challenging, especially when our minds are perpetually crowded with countless tasks waiting to be addressed.\\n\\nThe sheer volume of these tasks is daunting enough, but their source matters, too. It\u2019s one thing to generate your own to-do list; it\u2019s another to be inundated by the expectations and priorities of others. From well-meaning colleagues seeking help to the relentless pull of social media and advertising, Distractions clamor for our attention, often steering us away from what truly matters. This fractured focus drain our energy and leaves us mentally scattered. No wonder we often emerge from doom-scrolling or task-switching feeling exhausted and unfulfilled.\\n\\n### Pause, Reflect, Act\\n\\nOur minds are designed to thrive on deep focus, yet modern life constantly pulls us in multiple directions. Breaking free from this cycle requires more than willpower; it demands a deliberate reset.\\n\\nThe first step is to Pause. Like the old \\"stop, drop, and roll\\" advice for emergencies, breaking out of autopilot begins by stopping in our tracks. This moment of stillness interrupts the cycle of distraction, giving us a chance to regain control before we\u2019re swept away by the next default behavior.\\n\\nPausing creates space for Reflection. In this brief interval, we can assess the situation with fresh perspective, untangling ourselves from the emotions and impulses that led us astray. This clarity allows us to choose a better course of action\u2014one aligned with our true priorities.\\n\\nFinally, with renewed focus and energy, we can act intentionally. By directing our undivided attention to the one task or goal that matters most in the moment, we reclaim the power to engage deeply with our lives. The rare gift of full attention is not only a commodity worth striving for but also a foundation for meaningful work and personal fulfillment.\\n\\n### Actionable Tips to Regain Control\\n\\n1. **Pause:** Set aside just 5\u201310 minutes a day to step away from distractions. Use this time for calm reflection.\\n2. **Reflect:** Ask yourself: _What\u2019s currently demanding my attention? Is it truly worth it?_\\n3. **Prioritize:** Identify one thing that aligns with your goals or values to focus on.\\n4. **Take Action:** Commit to a small, meaningful step toward what matters most to you.\\n\\n### The Takeaway\\n\\nBy regularly pausing and reflecting, we can reclaim our attention, make clearer decisions, and focus on what truly matters\u2014living a life of intentionality rather than default.\\n\\n### Ask yourself\\n\\n1. What are the biggest sources of noise in your life right now?\\n2. When was the last time you paused to assess where your attention and energy are going?\\n3. What\u2019s one default behavior or routine you\u2019ve fallen into that you\u2019d like to change?\\n4.

We crave a peaceful, enjoyable life where we can focus on what we love and spend time with those who matter. Hardships, with their struggles, exhaustion, and pain, seem like the antithesis of happiness\u2014roadblocks we\u2019d rather avoid altogether. And when obstacles feel insurmountable, the stakes grow even higher. Failure can challenge not only our skills but also our self-image, shaking our confidence and how we think others perceive us. Avoiding challenges might seem like the safer, better option.\\n\\nBut a life devoid of challenges feels oddly hollow, like playing a game with cheat codes. It is precisely when we push ourselves to the limits of our abilities, testing our resolve, that we feel fully engaged and alive. A smooth, obstacle-free life might keep us comfortable, but it offers little in the way of growth or fulfillment. Without challenges, we abandon the very paths that lead to our personal and professional development.\\n\\n### Embracing Obstacles\\n\\nGrowth, however, rarely comes without effort. embracing obstacles isn\u2019t about making them easy but about reshaping how we perceive them. Obstacles, by their nature, test our character and skills. Learning to view them as opportunities rather than misfortunes can fundamentally shift our approach to life. This perspective is itself a challenge, but one that pays immense dividends.\\n\\nWhen we stop seeing hardships as enemies to our happiness and instead accept them as opportunities to grow, we begin to change the story we tell ourselves. Obstacles stop being threats to avoid and become milestones to overcome. They become less about ego and more about progress, transforming helplessness into proactiveness and pessimism into optimism. By reframing our perspective, we can move through life with greater clarity, confidence, and resilience, viewing each challenge as an invitation to become better.\\n\\n### Actionable Tips to Embracing Challenges\\n\\n- **Shift Your Perspective:**\\n    - When faced with a difficulty, ask yourself: _What can I learn from this? How can this make me stronger?_\\n    - Reframe challenges as stepping stones rather than roadblocks.\\n- **Take Small Steps:**\\n    - Break down the obstacle into manageable actions. Progress, even if small, builds momentum.\\n    - Celebrate each step forward to maintain motivation.\\n- **Stay Resilient:**\\n    - Accept that discomfort is part of growth. Remind yourself that the effort will pay off.\\n    - Lean on tools like journaling or supportive conversations to process struggles constructively.\\n- **Make It Fun:**\\n    - Find joy in the process. Approach challenges with curiosity, treating them as puzzles to solve rather than burdens to bear.\\n\\n### The Takeaway\\n\\nObstacles are not the enemy\u2014they are the pathway to growth. By recognizing the opportunities hidden within challenges and facing them head-on, we become stronger, wiser, and better equipped to handle life\u2019s complexities.\\n\\n### Ask yourself\\n\\n- How do you usually respond to challenges\u2014do you face them or avoid them?\\n- Can you recall a past obstacle that helped you grow in unexpected ways?\\n- What\u2019s one current difficulty you could reframe as an opportunity for growth?\\n- What small, actionable step can you take today to move closer to overcoming it?"},{"id":"tree-or-dandelion","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tree-or-dandelion","source":"@site/blog/are-you-a-tree-or-a-dandelion-insight.md","title":"Are you a tree or a dandelion","description":"Is it better to stand firm like a tree, or adapt like a dandelion?","date":"2024-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Challenges","permalink":"/blog/tags/challenges","description":"Overcoming obstacles and challenges in life"},{"inline":false,"label":"Change","permalink":"/blog/tags/change","description":"Embracing change and adapting to new situations"},{"inline":false,"label":"Personal-Identity","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal-identity","description":"Who are you?

At first glance, the tree seems like the obvious answer\u2014firm, unshakable, braving the harshest winds. We like to imagine ourselves as trees, rooted in an unchanging core that defines who we are. This is the fundamentalist view: anchoring our identity to a single, unmovable belief.\\n\\nBut what happens when a storm strong enough to uproot that tree arrives? Its fall is final.

Losing it might feel like losing ourselves. Instead, we can embrace the dandelion\u2019s approach: seeing our identity as a flexible network of ideas, not a rigid foundation.

Individual beliefs can shift or be replaced without collapsing who we are.\\n\\n### Actionable Tips to develop a \u201Cdandelion mindset\u201D\\n\\n- **Reflect:** Periodically revisit your beliefs. Do they still align with your experiences and values?\\n- **Seek Connections:** Explore how your beliefs support each other. Strengthen your network by engaging with diverse perspectives.\\n- **Embrace Change:** Be open to replacing outdated ideas with ones that better serve your growth.\\n- **Test Stability:** When encountering new ideas, ask yourself: Does this fit within my current network of beliefs? If not, can I adjust to accommodate it?\\n\\n### Ask Yourself\\n\\n- Where in your life are you more like a tree, rooted and resistant to change?\\n- Which parts of yourself are you most afraid to alter?\\n- Is there a belief you hold so tightly that losing it would shake your sense of self?\\n\\nIf these questions resonate with you, reply and let me know your thoughts\u2014I\u2019d love to hear how you see yourself in this metaphor."},{"id":"dont-be-a-black-box","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/dont-be-a-black-box","source":"@site/blog/dont-be-a-black-box---give-us-a-hint-synthesis.md","title":"Dont Be a Black Box - Give Us a Hint","description":"Ever tried coding without knowing the inputs?","date":"2024-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Communication","permalink":"/blog/tags/communication","description":"Understanding and improving communication skills"}],"readingTime":7.06,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"UUID":20230329173511,"Created":"2023-03-29 17:35","Modified":"2024-06-20 07:44","tags":["communication"],"Medium":["Obsidian"],"Description":"being understood is easier when it is explicit","ContentStatus":"Published","Version":1,"aliases":null,"draft":false,"slug":"dont-be-a-black-box","date":"2024-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","SiteProcssed":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Are you a tree or a dandelion","permalink":"/blog/tree-or-dandelion"},"nextItem":{"title":"Free Will is to Be Limited by Oneself","permalink":"/blog/free-will-is-to-be-limited"}},"content":"**Ever tried coding without knowing the inputs?**  \\nIt\'s messy, frustrating, and bound to fail, just like expecting others to read our minds in real life.

It would be like flying on a magic carpet, suddenly exploring a whole new world. However, there is only one Professor X, and he is purely fictional. For us, other people\'s thoughts will always remain hidden. To us humans, other minds are like black boxes; we simply have no way of knowing what is going on inside. We can\'t access their motives, beliefs, values, or reasons for acting the way they do. But as haters of Uncertainty, we feel compelled to know what\'s in that box\u2014or at least convince ourselves that we do.\\n\\nUnfortunately, our Curiosity is often matched by our laziness. Like someone who looks up spoilers for their favorite show, the easiest way to \\"know\\" what\'s inside the box is to rely on assumptions. We tend to believe that others\' reasons, beliefs, and values mirror our own, which can be a trap.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will explore the potential downsides of making assumptions about other people\'s minds. We\'ll discuss why, even if we could witness every thought, we might still be left in the dark. Finally, we\u2019ll propose a potential solution inspired by programming\u2014using type hints and docstrings\u2014to make the black box a bit more clearer.\\n\\n## When You Assume You Make An....\\n\\nAs the saying goes, assumptions are for donkeys\u2014or something like that. It should be no surprise that if understanding our own mind is so challenging, then grasping someone else\'s mind should be nearly impossible.\\n\\nThe first and foremost reason is that people are fundamentally different from us. Shocking, I know. It\'s not just that others have different reasons and values that drive their actions; even their logical reasoning can vary. This means that even if two people share the same motivations, they might still act differently. For instance, when feeling sad, some people prefer to be around others, seeking comfort and talking through their feelings. Others, when sad, prefer solitude, working through their emotions on their own. Same reasons, different actions.\\n\\nMoreover, people behave differently depending on the Context. We are constantly influenced by the environment around us, which means we might act one way with our friends and another way at work or with family. It\u2019s like how returning to your parents\' house can make you feel like the kid you once were.\\n\\nAnd even if, by some miracle, we manage to truly understand someone and predict how they will act in every situation\u2014that\'s great! But remember, you\'ll have to start all over again in a day, a month, or a year because people are always changing. Denying this is to deny our humanity and the inherent ability to change according to our beliefs. Therefore, any expectation we form about someone else comes with an expiration date.\\n\\n## Don\'t Skip if You Can\'t Read Minds\\n\\nIf you didn\u2019t skip this section, then welcome to the club\u2014you\u2019re one of us! Hurray! We \u201Cnormal\u201D people (if such a term can even be used) have to navigate understanding others without the benefit of mind reading. And just to make you feel a bit better, you should know that even if we could have that ability, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily help us understand others any better (sorry, Professor X).\\n\\nEven the field of Human Brain research, with all its promise of uncovering the secrets of the mind, is finding it increasingly challenging to pinpoint where \u201Cwe\u201D\u2014our consciousness\u2014reside within that pink blob of ours. Motives and intentions can be elusive, even if all our inner transmissions were laid bare for everyone to see.\\n\\nTrue understanding requires more than just transparency; it needs active efforts to communicate. In programming, for example, everything is always visible\u2014there are no \\"hidden lines of code.\\" Every action can be traced back to its origin. But if you think this means all code is equally easy to understand, you are, unfortunately, very, very, very wrong. Writing clean, clear code that is easy to understand requires effort, knowledge, and intention.\\n\\nSimilarly, understanding another person\'s mind is extremely difficult without effort and intention from them to help you understand. By providing translation, a map to guide others through the twists and turns of our minds, we can achieve a level of understanding that even a mind reader couldn\u2019t reach. A mind reader would likely get lost in the maze, just as we do when we try to assume what\u2019s in someone else\u2019s mind.\\n\\n## Anybody Has a Map?\\n\\n\\"Does anybody have a map?  \\nAnybody maybe happen to know how the hell to do this?  \\nI don\'t know if you can tell  \\nBut this is me just pretending to know  \\nSo where\'s the map?  \\nI need a clue  \\n\'Cause the scary truth is  \\nI\'m flyin\' blind  \\nI\'m making this up as I go.\\"\\n\\nCouldn\'t have said it better. These lyrics from *Dear Evan Hansen* capture the helplessness of trying to understand someone else without a map to guide you.\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve come this far, let\u2019s explore how we can prepare and deliver our own \\"maps\\" to others. In programming, we call these \\"type hints\\" and \\"docstrings\\"\u2014explanations that accompany the main code to make it much clearer. Others who attempt to understand and use our code can rely on these hints to know when it\'s relevant, what inputs are needed for it to work, and what outputs they can expect.\\n\\nInterestingly, these are the exact criteria we could use to make ourselves more understandable in our personal lives:\\n1. **Context** - What situations trigger a specific emotional reaction in you? For instance, introverts might feel uncomfortable in large crowds, or certain words may make you feel loved, ashamed, afraid, etc.\\n2. **Inputs** - What can be done to avoid negative outcomes and create a better experience for both parties? If I know the trigger words, I can avoid them, and together we can find more acceptable terms to use.\\n3. **Outputs** - What is likely to happen if we maintain the current situation versus adjusting our inputs? How does a certain action make me feel? Why is it important?\\n\\nAn example combining these elements might look like this:  \\n\\"Hey honey, I wanted to tell you that when you come home and leave your shoes in the bedroom, it makes me agitated (**Outputs**). When I grew up, we always kept our shoes next to the door (**Context**). To me, taking off shoes at the door symbolizes being truly home (**Outputs**), while guests kept their shoes on. So, would it be okay if you left your shoes by the door when you walk in? (**Inputs**)\\"\\n\\nThese hints are useful tools for establishing healthy Boundaries in your life. However, they don\u2019t need to be presented as ultimatums. Instead, they can be part of a conversation where the primary goal is mutual understanding. As with any interaction, first seek to understand, then to be understood. Developing better communication skills is key to improving your well-being, and, of course, both parties must feel comfortable in the process.\\n\\nAnd remember\u2014not to forget! When someone has taken the time to provide a \\"map\\" to their mind, it\u2019s crucial to use it. If they\'ve made the effort to explain themselves, the least we can do is keep it in mind. Logging can be a helpful tool for that!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nMind reading is overrated\u2014we barely focus on our own thoughts, so who needs more of those? Instead, to understand others and to be understood by them, we simply need to make the implicit explicit. Don\u2019t assume it\u2019s obvious, and don\u2019t assume others see things the way you do. Just say it. You\u2019d be surprised how often five minutes of conversation can solve hours of struggle. \\n\\nYou don\u2019t have to spell everything out, just provide a few hints here and there, like a good programmer. Make your mind more readable by drawing a map for others to follow.\\n\\nLet me know what you think about communication, boundaries and every thing in between, and until then -\\nEmbrace, enrich and evolve.\\n\\n## Further Reading\\nOther books related to healthy communication\\nThe 5 Love Languages (book)"},{"id":"free-will-is-to-be-limited","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/free-will-is-to-be-limited","source":"@site/blog/free-will-is-to-be-limited-by-oneself-synthesis.md","title":"Free Will is to Be Limited by Oneself","description":"Is free will about giving in, or taking control?","date":"2024-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Self-Control","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-control","description":"How to take control of your life and make better decisions"},{"inline":false,"label":"Personal-Identity","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal-identity","description":"Who are you?

Real free will is an internal agreement, a collaboration between all parts of yourself. It takes compromise, creativity, and the courage to listen to your whole self.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What is Free Will Anyway?\\n\\nWe often think that having free will, if it even exists, is synonymous with having Self-control\u2014the ability for our will to overcome resistance so we can act according to our true desires. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, so let\u2019s start.\\n\\nThe first and most significant issue is the term \\"self-control.\\" Who, exactly, is the one in control, and who is being controlled? It\u2019s as if we\u2019re on one side of a conflict, locked in an endless battle against a mysterious foe that resides within us. \\n\\nIn reality, we are actually on both sides of the conflict simultaneously. When we seek self-control, we are essentially fighting against ourselves. And if you fight yourself, no matter who wins, you always lose.\\n\\nIn this post, I suggest that free will is not about control, and certainly not about subduing or overpowering parts of ourselves. Rather than a \\"simple\\" binary state of conflict, I propose a more nuanced definition that might sound counterintuitive at first\u2014but hear me out.\\n\\nTo have free will means to set limitations on yourself, by yourself, through a process of internal deliberation and harmony. I know that sounds complex, so let\u2019s break it down.\\n\\n## The Illusion of Unbridled Freedom\\n\\nLet\'s take a closer look at our internal state of conflict. If we imagine \\"us\\" battling against some part of ourselves, what exactly is that part? Typically, we see these things as our internal desires, the primal urges, or our default behaviors. What would happen if we allowed that side to act as it pleases?\\n\\nFor many of us, this is the default way of life\u2014or at least where a significant portion of our attention and time is devoted. We feel these urges deep within, like a volcano on the verge of eruption, with an inner voice growing louder and louder until we finally respond. These desires often manifest in the form of things that bring immediate pleasure, such as food, entertainment, or sex. Even our social needs find instant gratification through scrolling social media, where we experience and explore other people\'s lives (or at least their perceived image of them).\\n\\nIn essence, when left to \\"our own devices,\\" we surrender our free will to basic chemistry and biology. Our minds, which are attuned to seek gratification, find endless opportunities in the modern world.\\n\\nThis isn\'t accidental, of course. The economy of recent centuries has evolved to provide quicker and more satisfying answers to these fundamental desires, with fast food, pocket-sized entertainment, and an unlimited supply of \\"stuff\\" we can own.\\n\\nIgnoring the conflict between our desires and our will doesn\'t leave us in a neutral state. The world around us is shaped to influence us on the deepest and most powerful levels possible, meaning that even inaction is a decision of sorts. \\n\\nBy mindlessly following our desires, we end up pitting ourselves against the collective efforts of an entire economy\u2014one that is expertly designed to capture and hold our attention. In such a battle, it\'s easy to predict who the winner will be.\\n\\n## The Tyranny of Partial Self-Control\\n\\nIf our internal urges can be so harmful, then we must control them... right? After all, by relinquishing our desire for control, it seems we won\'t be guided toward our own happiness, but rather end up satisfying a biological urge or someone else\'s economic ambitions.\\n\\nSo, we might think we have no choice but to take control. But as we mentioned earlier, who exactly are we fighting? Are humans simply a mix of desires, some \\"good\\" and some \\"bad,\\" that we must eliminate?\\n\\nAt best, this approach denies our humanity as biological beings, suggesting we are nothing more than noble aspirations. At worst\u2014and more realistically\u2014we end up declaring war on ourselves, believing we need to conquer, subdue, and eradicate any parts we consider harmful.\\n\\nFighting against ourselves is a path to self-destruction, almost by definition. It involves wasting mental energy, focus, and time resisting something intrinsic to us, overlooking its potential benefits, and reducing the complexity of our humanity.\\n\\nFor instance, without the part of our brain that drives us to seek pleasure, we would become completely apathetic, lacking motivation to do anything, whether \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\" Without so-called \\"negative\\" emotions like anger or frustration, what would compel us to seek justice or strive for improvement? By labeling ourselves \\"weak,\\" \\"lazy,\\" or \\"fragile,\\" do we genuinely stand a chance of becoming better, or are we just sinking deeper into despair?\\n\\nIt\'s like trying to \\"will yourself\\" into not needing sleep. After all, sleep takes up so many hours of the day that could be spent being more productive or having more experiences. But as we know, when we sleep less, we tend to be less productive.\\n\\nWhen we treat ourselves as potential enemies who can\'t be trusted, how can we ever achieve inner peace? It seems that in our attempt to exercise free will, we may only end up with the opposite result.\\n\\n## Free Will as Harmonious Coexistence\\n\\nWhat are we supposed to do if we can\'t simply let our inner urges run wild or try to control them? The answer\u2014difficult as it is and counterintuitive as it may sound\u2014is to reach an agreement. An agreement on which limitations we should impose on ourselves. These self-imposed limitations are the true symbol of free will.\\n\\nThere is beauty and Truth in all of our aspects, like organs working together to form a body, each with its own role. If one side forces another into submission, you don\'t achieve free will\u2014you create dysfunction, like cancer. Free will is an act that arises from your entire being, which is a combination of all those different voices.\\n\\nHowever, those voices don\'t always need equal say. Deliberation isn\'t necessarily a purely democratic process\u2014at least not in the simple political sense where one person equals one vote. But in another sense, it is the most democratic thing there is, because it requires understanding across all perspectives and consensus on what the best course of action is. There is no \\"one truth\\" that grants any single side eternal authority; instead, roles can rotate depending on the Context.\\n\\nInitially, compromises will likely be necessary. It\'s not easy to change or reach an agreement when we are accustomed to a particular pattern. However, in the long run, we may achieve an optimal point where all those voices align in the same direction. This will require effort and time to develop the necessary virtues to create a synthesis of yourself.\\n\\nThat synthesis will not only be the true reflection of who you are\u2014your authenticity\u2014but it will also represent the only true act of free will you can have.\\n\\nThe first step, as always, is to develop Self-awareness. This means really listening to our inner voices while also understanding that, like people, those voices can always change and grow. More on that in another post, but a useful tool could be journaling, to record your thoughts, feelings, and emotions for the present and as a reflective tool.\\n\\nI don\'t want to provide too many examples, as it might diminish the gravity of the topic, but here are a couple of actions that can result from such an agreement\u2014a form of self-limitation. For example, Temptation Bundling is a powerful tool that combines both our desire for pleasure and our will to do what\'s right or necessary. Similarly, viewing failure as an opportunity to improve can help us convert frustration into motivation, thus honoring both our emotions and our growth process.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhether you don\'t assume any control over your actions or you believe that free will means letting the rational side dominate, in both cases, you end up becoming a slave\u2014to yourself. Either you give in to temptations without limitations, or you listen only to one part of yourself. Free will is about simultaneously freeing and limiting yourself because a true will is the combination of all the sides within you that must come to an agreement. That agreement requires compromise, creativity, and adaptations to accommodate all the different perspectives within you.\\n\\nLet me know what you think about free will, self control and every thing in between, and until then -\\nEmbrace, enrich and evolve\\n\\n## Further Reading\\nEthics of ambiguity (book)"}]}}')}}]);
