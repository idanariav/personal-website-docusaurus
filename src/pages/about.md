# 🧠 About Me

Hey there! I’m Idan Ariav, a curious thinker and lifelong learner with a passion for detecting insights across data, knowledge, and ideas. I convert complexity into clarity, I build systems for consistent high quality outputs, and share what I learn along the way.

My work centers around three main pillars:

---

## 📊 1. Professional Experience: Advanced Data Analytics

With a background in data analysis, I’ve spent the last few years helping organizations turn messy data into clear decisions. From building dashboards and automating reports to leading data science projects, I love bringing structure and clarity to complex problems.

> **Tools I frequently use**: Python, Pyspark, Airflow, Tableau.

---

## 🗃️ 2. Knowledge Management: Thinking in Systems

Outside of my day job, I design systems to capture, organize, and resurface ideas. Whether it’s developing personal knowledge management (PKM) workflows or helping teams retain institutional wisdom, I believe that **how we manage knowledge directly impacts what we can create**.

> **Examples**: note-taking workflows, project management, and smart content retrieval.

## 📝 3. Content Creation: The Philosopher’s Code

I also write a newsletter called **Philosopher’s Code**, where I explore ideas at the intersection of **philosophy, productivity, and personal growth**. It’s where I reflect on timeless questions and translate them into practical insights you can apply.
