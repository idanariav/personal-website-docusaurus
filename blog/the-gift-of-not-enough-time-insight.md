# The Gift of Not Enough

We constantly wish for more time while dreading life's ultimate deadline. But what if the very scarcity we fear is actually the profound source of meaning, purpose, and urgency in our lives? Is it possible that embracing our finite nature is the key to truly living aligned with what matters?

We spend our lives asking for more time. As kids, it’s “five more minutes.” As adults, a few more hours to reach our goals. As parents, a few more years before our children grow up.

Beyond all these deadlines waits the final one: death.

The thought can be scary and frustrating. We want to do and see so much. Like visitors at an all-you-can-eat buffet, we often make ourselves sick trying to taste everything instead of savoring a single, enjoyable meal.

But what if the scarcity of life isn't a bad thing? I hope I won't regret these words when my own deadline comes. For now, with death seeming so far away, I can find the courage to see it for what it truly is: the source of all meaning.

This is what Heidegger called "being-toward-death." To live an authentic life, we must confront our own mortality. This forces us to take ownership of our choices. As he put it: "If I take death into my life, acknowledge it, and face it squarely, I will free myself from the anxiety of death and the pettiness of life—and only then will I be free to become myself."

Let me explain.

## How Scarcity Creates Meaning

Imagine you had the cheat codes for youthful immortality. At first, you'd be thrilled. You could stop saving for retirement, travel without limits, or finally take those guitar lessons you always wanted. Your bucket list could grow infinitely since you'd have time for everything.

Without a deadline, however, there’s no urgency. Why do something today if you can always do it tomorrow? When there's no need to prioritize, everything seems equally important, which means nothing is truly significant.

As finite beings, we constantly face trade-offs. Choosing one path means forgoing many others, and this opportunity cost is what gives weight to our commitments. A dollar from a billionaire doesn’t carry the same significance as 10% of a struggling family’s income. The more we have to give up for something, the more meaning it holds.

The finiteness of our time and resources is what makes our joys, sacrifices, and promises matter.

This isn’t to say death or hardship are good. They aren’t. But acknowledging our limits frees us to live in alignment with what matters now.

The Stoics believed that contemplating death isn't depressing, but liberating. It gives us clarity on what is truly important and encourages us to live each day with virtue and purpose, as if it were our last.

As Marcus Aurelius said, "You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think."

## How to Live with It

Recognizing scarcity can push us into the opposite trap: feeling that if our time is limited, we must be absolutely sure we're spending it on the "right" things.

This can lead to analysis paralysis, where we endlessly debate our choices. It's a waste of precious time and a source of constant FOMO and anxiety. A famous example is "Buridan's donkey," which stands between two identical stacks of hay. Unable to choose which one to eat, it starves to death.

Instead, we should simply make a choice and stick with it until there's a clear reason to adjust:
• You don’t need the perfect job if you enjoy the one you have.
• You don’t have to see every country; we are the ones who decide what makes a place beautiful and worthwhile.
• Not every minute needs to be optimized. There's peace in simply enjoying the moment.

When we lower the bar from "changing the world" to "living a good life," we can let go of the stress of our limitations and focus on what matters most to us right now.
