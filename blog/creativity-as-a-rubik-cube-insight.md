# Creativity as a Rubik's Cube

Is creativity simply reimagining existing ideas in new ways? What if the true essence of innovation lies not in creating something entirely original but in skillfully blending familiar elements? Discover how your unique experiences and perspectives can unlock your creative potential and lead to extraordinary insights. Are you ready to explore the art of creativity?

Creativity is a complex skill to define, often described as the ability to bring something new to life. It contrasts with imitation, like how AI mixes existing materials without true innovation.

However, creativity might actually involve using familiar materials in novel ways and deciding how to use them. It’s similar to a Rubik's cube, which offers countless configurations within the constraints of a 3x3 grid and six colors.

Imagine visiting an art museum. The variety of paintings seems endless, yet they likely used the same colors, either directly or mixed. What made some paintings captivating was how the artists used those colors creatively.

Two artists with the same palette will produce distinct works. Using the same shade of red doesn't constitute plagiarism. Similarly, bands use common instruments and music principles, yet a wide variety of musical styles exist. While the essence (notes and instruments) stays the same, their interaction (form) changes entirely.

Thus, the focus should be on finding new ways to reimplement existing knowledge, not creating entirely new things.

New approaches might not come from overspecializing, as each problem is approached with the default tools and perspectives of that domain. As John Stuart Mill said, "He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that."

By merging knowledge from different areas, we enhance our chances of discovering unique solutions through borrowed ideas. For instance, an evolutionary theorist might gain insights from game theory models in economics.

Your skill set, history, and perspective are the foundations of your creativity. You may not be the best in any field, but few people share your unique combination of interests.

It's not enough to just "be you." If it were, most creative processes would already be discovered. It requires hard work, specifically:
1. **Open-mindedness** - Your creativity is limited by your thoughts. Seek out different perspectives and step outside your comfort zone, as Henri Poincaré suggests: "The mind uses its faculty for creativity only when experience forces it to do so."
2. **Experimentation** - This separates valuable from useless ideas. Whether succeeding or failing, you learn from trying out ideas.
3. **Play** - Pursue curiosity without a specific hypothesis or end goal. Although it may seem pointless, it can lead to remarkable new ideas.

Creativity resembles inventing the lightbulb. A moment of inspiration rests on a foundation of "failed" experiments and hard work. Don't expect success on the first try.

Creativity is an iterative process. Set aside your ego and goals, focus on doing and learning as much as possible.

What seems easy for you might not be for others, which is your unique advantage. It won't guarantee overnight success, but it serves as a compass for your creative journey.

Creativity isn't about reaching a final masterpiece, it's about opening unseen doors. Each exploration, play, and experiment creates new connections, making creativity less mysterious and more a power you can summon at any time.
