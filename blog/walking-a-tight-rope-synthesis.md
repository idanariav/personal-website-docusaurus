# Walking a Tight Rope

Is living a good and happy life truly an impossible balancing act? How do we strive for our values while recognizing our limitations? Explore the delicate dance between self-improvement and self-acceptance, and discover how facing hardships can lead to growth. Are you ready to find your balance amidst life's challenges?

We aspire to be good people, yet it's unrealistic to expect ourselves to be saints who volunteer all day. We aim to achieve great things in life, but this often comes at a high cost, such as neglecting our relationships. We seek a calling, yet we often face either an overwhelming number of options or none at all.

If only life were that simple, but it is quite the opposite. Finding a meaningful goal and committing to it is challenging enough. On top of that, we grapple with competing values that pull us in different directions, making every step forward a struggle.

Despite how difficult it may seem, I believe this complexity is a fundamental aspect of being human. To illustrate this, let's explore alternative ways of living.

Kierkegaard identified two types of unsatisfying lives:

1. Being lost in the finite - dedicating yourself entirely to one project and becoming one with it, spending all your time, thoughts, and focus on it.
2. Being lost in the infinite - attempting to "do it all," succumbing to FOMO with an endless pursuit of an ever-growing wish list, and feeling a constant need to change your life and try something new.

I would add a third option that he overlooked:

3. The concept of "philosophical suicide" as described by Camus - giving up entirely and living without striving for anything "special" in life, feeling that everything is meaningless or arbitrary.

I believe we oscillate between these ideas rather than fixating on just one.

We may immerse ourselves in our jobs, working long hours at the expense of friendships and sleep. Once we reach the top, we might feel compelled to compensate for what we missed, attempting to check everything off our bucket list. Yet, along the way, we may experience an indescribable emptiness despite fulfilling many dreams.

We often gravitate toward one of these options because it provides certainty. In our quest for life's meaning, we tend to choose the most convenient option available, regardless of its truth. Living with uncertainty, constantly questioning the big issues without answers, is frustrating, to say the least.

But what is the alternative? To walk a tightrope above the abyss of being human:

• To commit to a cause while remembering that we are not defined by a single aspect of our lives.
• To choose a path, even if it feels arbitrary like many others, knowing we may never see its end.
• To strive for improvement while embracing our imperfect selves.

There is no easy answer to where this balance lies, but it is the only answer we have.

We can debate, argue, and deny, but just as the Earth revolves around the sun despite our beliefs, we cannot escape the abyss.

We can only decide how to cross it.

This is a journey you must undertake on your own. No one can make the choice for you, and be cautious of those who promise you "the truth to a good life."

That answer will likely evolve over time, just as you do, and that's perfectly okay.

This is why my slogan is "join the journey." I don't have all the answers for you, but together, we might find some inspiration.

## Ask Yourself

1. What does being a "good person" mean to me, and how do I strive to embody that in my daily life?
2. In what areas of my life do I feel I am sacrificing one value for another? How can I create a better balance?
3. What are my passions and interests, and how do they align with my current pursuits?
