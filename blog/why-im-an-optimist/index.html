<!-- -->With so much going wrong in the world, pessimism feels like the “realistic” choice. But what if the way we see the world changes what we get from it? This post explores how choosing optimism isn’t about ignoring problems—but believing we can overcome them.</p>
<p><img decoding=async loading=lazy alt=why_im_still_an_optimist.webp src=/assets/images/why_im_still_an_optimist-a268ae0fff035ba491dc150b7713ac92.webp width=1263 height=980 class=img_ev3q /></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id=introduction>Introduction<a href=#introduction class=hash-link aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction" translate=no>​</a></h2>
<p>Is the glass half full or half empty? Are people inherently good? What will become of our world? Given the wars, epidemics, and political turmoil in recent years, it's hard not to lean toward pessimism. In fact, it might even seem realistic to believe that things will probably go wrong.</p>
<p>However, what we see is what we get. When we choose to view the world through dark-colored glasses, it's no surprise that everything suddenly seems more depressing. While we don’t control the world, we do control how we view it, and this choice has a significant impact on how we experience life, others, and our overall well-being.</p>
<p>Becoming an optimist can strengthen our relationships with others, improve our happiness, sharpen our minds, and help us solve problems rather than drowning in them. Don’t get me wrong - optimism isn’t about ignoring our problems. It’s about having the conviction that we can overcome them and knowing that even when new problems arise (and they will), they won’t stop us from becoming who we can be and believing that we can make things better.</p>
<p>So, let's happily dive in.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id=optimism-to-the-rescue>Optimism to the Rescue<a href=#optimism-to-the-rescue class=hash-link aria-label="Direct link to Optimism to the Rescue" title="Direct link to Optimism to the Rescue" translate=no>​</a></h2>
<p>While we can relate the optimist/pessimist dilemma to how we view the world, the most important question is how we view <em>our</em> world - what happens to us personally (who wouldn't agree that we matter most?).</p>
<p>More specifically, the question is how we perceive supposedly negative things that happen to us and the challenges we face. We often revert to becoming the victim, thinking, "Why did this happen to me?" or "How will I ever overcome this?" We feel powerless, hopeless, and angry at the world, as if a huge rock hangs above our heads or walls surround us, threatening to crush us. Worst of all, even if there are some good things that come along with it, we become completely blind to them or dismiss them because they clash with our "victim narrative."</p>
<p>The biggest, hardest, and most meaningful change we can make is to realize that events are neither good nor bad - we make them so. This doesn't mean we are indifferent to them; we would never be indifferent between losing a loved one and winning the lottery. Nor does it mean we won't experience negative emotions like anger or sadness. Unpleasant things will happen, and pain will come, but what we choose to do about it is entirely within our control.</p>
<p>When we understand that our reaction is completely in our hands, that we are always free to choose how to respond, we realize the power we have over any situation. We can transform obstacles into stepping stones, using these obstacles as opportunities to grow, learn, and become better.</p>
<p>Those who choose to drown in misery are consumed by it and become slaves to it. Their mental and physical health weakens, they remain stagnant, and they focus on failure, unable to see a way out. However, when we choose to see the usefulness in these obstacles, when we see a chance to rise above them, we are most likely able to. It's fake it till you make it all the way to the top. We acknowledge that having challenges is what helps us grow - a do-or-die moment from which we emerge stronger and better.</p>
<p>I had a personal experience where I was completely isolated from my friends and family, forced to participate in activities that went against the core of my being, and lived in almost inhumane conditions. Was it a pleasant experience? Would I want something like that to happen to me again? Absolutely not. I experienced pain and suffering. But did I gain something from it? Definitely. I had a lot of time to reflect on my life, who I am, and what I believe in. Those harsh conditions stretched the limits of what I thought I could endure. I survived and returned stronger and more confident in myself, and for that, I am grateful. I chose to focus on the positive side of it all, rather than be consumed by sadness.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id=can-there-be-too-much-of-a-good-thing>Can there Be Too much of a Good Thing?<a href=#can-there-be-too-much-of-a-good-thing class=hash-link aria-label="Direct link to Can there Be Too much of a Good Thing?" title="Direct link to Can there Be Too much of a Good Thing?" translate=no>​</a></h2>
<p>Being too optimistic can be a bad thing. If we start seeing everything through rose-tinted glasses, we might miss out on some red flags. Thinking "there's good in every bad" might make us less risk-averse than we should be, causing us not to take the necessary precautions or to neglect developing our capabilities such that those negative things would be avoided in the first place. We become less inquisitive, less informed about potential hazards, and overconfident without the knowledge to back it up.</p>
<p>When optimism turns into wishful thinking or daydreaming without being balanced with a touch of realism, we might become careless about what happens to us, believing that "things will work out in the end," and forgetting the important distinction between what's within our power to change and our obligation to act on it.</p>
<p>So, why not just be a realist? Realists seem to have the best of both worlds: seeing the world "as it truly is" without judgment, trying to look only at the facts, and working with what they have. While it sounds promising, I think that being a realist is a false hope for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>We are never without our glasses</strong> - There is a long history of debate on whether we can ever truly remove our mental lenses through which we see the world - even down to perceiving simple details like shape or color. It's unclear if attempting to see the complex world of human interaction in its raw form, without Narratives or judgment, is worthwhile, let alone possible. Most likely, those who claim neutrality are more delusional than accurate.</li>
<li class=""><strong>We are bad at prediction</strong> - Even if we could separate facts from opinions and look at the cold, hard reality, what does it tell us about the future? Unfortunately, humans are notoriously bad at making guesses, even educated ones. Political experts are mistaken more often than not, and even those who get it right are likely to fail on their next guess. Just look at how much data and complex math is required to create basic computer models to forecast the future - and even then, it's "approximately almost right." Therefore, just knowing the facts is not enough, since the future is still blurry. We are not exempt from making judgments that inherently involve values, beliefs, and biases.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id=cultivating-balanced-optimism>Cultivating Balanced Optimism<a href=#cultivating-balanced-optimism class=hash-link aria-label="Direct link to Cultivating Balanced Optimism" title="Direct link to Cultivating Balanced Optimism" translate=no>​</a></h2>
<p>It seems that to maintain a healthy level of optimism, we need to balance two extremes: "acknowledging the hardships of the world" and "noticing and reframing reality in a more positive, protective way."</p>
<p>So, how can we do both of these things?</p>
<p>How to Cultivate Realism:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Practice mindfulness</strong> - Try to quiet your mind and reflect on your thoughts, senses, and the world around you without any judgments or filters. Mindfulness helps you observe reality as it is, not as you wish it to be.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Draw Your Circle of Control</strong> - Consider what you are capable of controlling in your life and what is beyond your control. For instance, you always have the freedom to choose how to react, how to use your spare time, and which commitments are still worth following. On the other hand, recognize that you don’t control the state of the economy, events of random luck, or how others choose to act.</li>
</ol>
<p>How to Cultivate Optimism:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Believe in Yourself</strong> - Embrace a growth mindset, trusting that you can change and grow. Avoid harsh self-criticism and practice self-compassion, recognizing that everyone makes mistakes and that they are opportunities for growth.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Express gratitude</strong> - Reflect daily on what you are grateful for. These can be small things, such as enjoying a warm meal, having a pleasant conversation with a friend, or witnessing a beautiful sunrise.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Be Kind</strong> - Make an effort to perform small acts of kindness each day. This could be as simple as holding the door for someone, helping a colleague at work, or doing something thoughtful for your partner or family.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Reframe Challenges</strong> - Focus on how the challenges in your life can help you grow. Consider what you can learn from them, viewing them as opportunities to practice your skills, like a workout for the mind. Embrace them not just as a natural part of life, but as a necessary step to becoming a stronger, more resilient person.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id=conclusion>Conclusion<a href=#conclusion class=hash-link aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" translate=no>​</a></h2>
<p>Being an optimist is more than just seeing the glass as half full, it's about finding a tap and filling it completely. It's not about ignoring the half-empty side but rather taking action to address it, facing challenges head-on.</p>
<p>Being an optimist is a choice - one of the best choices we can make. It involves surrounding ourselves with positivity in the most protective way, believing in our power and the power of others to bring goodness into the world, while still acknowledging all the flaws and faults that exist. It means treating obstacles as opportunities for growth without dismissing the difficult emotions they bring.</p>
<p>Believing that everything and everyone is terrible is easy, but doing something to improve the situation is hard. It’s a struggle worth embracing, and it carries with it the awakening truth that optimism is the best and only solution for a better life. No matter how challenging it may be, it's better to be a hopeful optimist than a "right" pessimist.</div></div></div><footer class=docusaurus-mt-lg><div class="row margin-top--sm
