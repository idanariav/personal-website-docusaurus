# Welcome

Welcome!

So happy you are here. You might ask where "here" is. The most honest answer would be - welcome to my brain:)

## What is this place

This is my "knowledge vault", an ever evolving collection of interconnected notes about every book I've read, every concept I thought about, every idea I wanted to share with the world, it's all in here for you to enjoy (or not, that's up to you). 

Feel free to roam around, there are notes about morality, productivity,happiness and so much more. **Simply use the search bar to see what comes up and travel through the links from there**. 

## Folder Structure

This folder has three main sesctions:
1. **Notes** - core atomic ideas, the basic building block of knowledge
2. **Maps of Content** - Each note is an overview of a given topic. For example the Existentialism Map of content (or MOC for short) links to all the notes that are related to that topic.
3. **Book Summaries** - A detailed summary for non-fiction books, including a general summary and analysis, and a chapter by chapter summary.
