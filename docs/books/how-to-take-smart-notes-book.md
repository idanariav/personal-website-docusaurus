# How to Take Smart Notes (book)

## ✒️ Note-Making

### 🔗Connect
🔼Topic:: [PKM (Map)](/mocs/pkm-map.md)

### 💡Clarify
🔈 *Summary of main ideas* 
1. **Writing is thinking** - Writing is not the end result of a thinking process, but rather a part of the process itself. By forcing ourselves to write about a topic, we are much more likely to detect the holes in our knowledge, and by trying to explain it to others we improve our learning.
2. **Thinking amplifiers** - Our mind is not meant to store endless knowledge, instead it works much better as a processer. Once we dump our knowledge into an external system through writing, we are able to focus on what matters - which is to consume content mindfully, to think deeply about a single thing each time, to distill a source into it's core aspects, to separate the valuable from the redundant, to detect connections between ideas.
3. **Bottom up thinking** - thinking or writing is shallow when we try to implement a top down approach, i.e to choose a topic and start writing on a blank page. Instead, we should be guided by our passion. To see which topics and connections pop up in our slip-box, and to let it guide what we choose to write about. An additional advantage is that we don't start writing from scratch, but rather have a vast collection of notes to work with. To make it work, we need to connect and tag notes not based on topic, but rather what is the context (the cues) in which we would like this note to resurface
4. **Knowledge management is an holistic system**  - Having a system in place helps us become better writers and thinkers because it helps us avoid distractions, it brings simplicity to the process and reduces the number of decisions we have to make along the way. Such a system doesn't arise naturally, we have to intentionally create it and not just pick and choose different aspects of it. It's advantages are emerging properties of having all the pieces working together harmonically. 
### 🗒️Relate

⛓ *by following this method, what will happen? What is the goal of this book?*
1. **Better thinker and writer** - we need to externalize our knowledge in order to process it fully, we make room in our mind to think about ideas when we empty it out. So externalizing both clears our brain, and in the process we write more, so we are more practiced with it. Additionally, we have much more written knowledge to start with when we want to write a longer essay. 
### 🔍Critique

✅ *relevant research, metaphors or examples that helps to convey the argument*
Lumin with the help of his slip-box had managed to publish countless books and articles.

❌ *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*
Is there really no other way to have good knowledge management other than the slip box method? Something that someone has done once and had huge success is enough? (although Lumin is unheard of aside from the zettlkasten knowledge)

🧱 *Implementations and limitations of it are...*

### 🗨️Review

💭 *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
I remember how I waited to read this book when I just started diving into the pkm world, now a few years after, I have to say that this book is hardly innovating. It is highly repetitive, and the attempt to persuade us to use the slip-box method is partial in it's success. Tying the content of the book to the slip-box method narrows it's scope which makes it shallow and limited, while if it only focused on the ideas of writing and documenting knowledge this could have been much better. 
### 🖼️Outline

## 📒 Notes

### Introduction

We all write, because writing is not the end product of the process of thinking, rather it is an essential part of the process itself, **we think through writing**. The problem is that we assume that writing starts when we have chosen a topic and now face an empty note waiting to be filled.

The truth is that good writing starts earlier in the preparation phase. It is all about [systematical thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md), by having a good system set in place, we can [trust the process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), we can let go of the belief that all the content has to be constantly remembered and situated in our mind, and focus on writing. Therefore it is not our IQ that determines the quality of our work, but rather the systems we set up. A good system also reduces the need for [Self discipline](/notes/self-control.md) because it reduces [friction](/notes/friction.md) and creates a sense of [flow](/notes/flow.md), which is much more beneficial than relying on willpower because [willpower is limited](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md). They also reduce the threats of [procrastination](/notes/procrastination.md)

Such a system doesn't get built by chance, it is the result of a conscious choice. This doesn't mean that it is a complex system, on the contrary, it's beauty is in it's [simplicity](/notes/simplicity.md), which means you don't have to rearrange what you've already done, you just need to get started. However, it does require an holistic approach, just focusing on one or two aspects will remove it's benefits, i.e the system's benefits are an [emerging](/notes/emergence.md) property. 

That system, is [Zettelkasten 2bc](/notes/zettelkasten-2bc.md) (or the "slip-box"), this system uses the concept of [atomism](/notes/atomism.md) and [extended mind](/notes/extended-mind.md) to be able to externalize and [distilling](/notes/distillment.md) ideas into small parts that can be put together in different ways, facilitating [Connection Making](/notes/coherentism.md).

The key is also to [engage](/notes/engagement.md) with the notes, it's more than coping highlights, it's to think, process and connect them to other ideas.

In short, the system is:
1. **Literature notes** - notes about external sources such as books and articles
2. **Main notes** - Ideas that are related to both literature notes and each other
3. **Index notes** - Notes that serve as a map to locate other notes on the same topic

:::note[INTRODUCTION]

- Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=72))
- good, productive writing is based on good note-taking. ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=94))
- The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=96))
- Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=116))

:::note[Everything You Need to Know]

- A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=123))
- A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=127))
- if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can’t be compensated by a high IQ. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=299))
- We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=354))

### Everything you need to do

We learn best the more we engage with what we learn, and writing is a part of that. Not only emptying your mind, but also attempting to explain it to others [learning by doing](/notes/learning-by-doing.md)

a typical workflow:
1. **Fleeting notes** - capture ideas quickly from your mind, doesn't matter the quality or the medium, just to serve as a remainder and put it in your inbox [our mind is a processor and not a warehouse](/notes/our-mind-is-a-processor-and-not-a-warehouse.md)
2. **Literature notes** - take notes about the things you read/consume. Follow your passion about which content to invest in, and don't focus too much about having a "plan", motivation is the key here
3. **Permanent notes** - distill your literature and fleeting notes into a permanent note. Write it as if you explain it to someone else [Feynman Technique](/notes/feynman-technique.md), in your own words, as concise, simple and clear as possible. Connect each note to a "topic note", and to other related notes.

:::note[Everything You Need to Do]

- Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=386))
- Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=414))

:::


### Everything you need to have

A good system's main attribute is [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md), the simpler it is, the better it works.

The slip box method require:
1. something to write with/on
2. A slip box
3. A reference manager
4. A text editor

:::note[Everything You Need to Have]

- The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=486))

:::


### A few things to keep in mind

A tool is only useful if we proficient in it

### The four underlying principle

#### Writing is the only thing that matters 

Writing is the main tool of research, therefore it should be it's focus. Everything we do as part of the research process should be evaluated by how much it improves our writing, i.e the quality of the content written.

#### Simplicity is paramount

The advantage of a slip-box method is an emergent property, it gets better the more it grows, thanks to:
1. **Bottom up approach** - Instead of trying to divide ideas into topics, which gets messy the more notes and topics we have, we arrange ideas by context, i.e "where would I want to encounter the idea next". A bottom up approach is much more resilient to size, and it allows for creation of new (and multiple) contexts as the knowledge grows.
2. **Pruning** - If we keep every thought we ever had, it is going to get messy, and good ideas will be lost between all the [noise](/notes/noise.md). That's why it's important for us to have the "fleeting notes", a place where we only temporarily store ideas, and process them into permanent note if we see value in them. 

Explore many different fields, not just the one you are currently interested in [Range](/notes/breath-beats-depth.md), because you don't know which notes/content will be the one who will give you the most insights [pareto principle](/notes/pareto-principle.md)

:::note[Simplicity Is Paramount]

- Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=701))

:::


#### Nobody ever starts from scratch

First choosing a topic to write about and then focusing on it is a sure way to get writers block and dread from that blank page. Writing is a bottoms up approach. After we have explored and made notes about various topics, some would spark our interest, which means we first do the research, and then we can start writing with a few well written notes as our support.

:::note[Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]

- The things you are supposed to find in your head by brainstorming usually don’t have their origins in there. Rather, they come from the outside: through reading, having discussions and listening to others, ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=779))

:::


#### Let the work carry you forward

A good workflow creates a [Positive feedback loop](/notes/ripple-effect.md) of improvement, because it provides multiple opportunities for [feedback](/notes/feedback.md). Every time we are trying to process an idea and write it in our own words, we get feedback on how well we really understood the idea, and how well can we express it in writing. Therefore the slip-box method not only "forces" us to make many small notes i.e more chances of getting feedback vs one large paper, we also are "forced" to write our thoughts which is the only way to improve both at thinking and in writing. This system promotes a [growth mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md)

:::note[Let the Work Carry You Forward]

- A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=816))
- The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes – and only by doing it with the chance of realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=858))
- It is not the slip-box or our brains alone, but the dynamic between them that makes working with it so productive. ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=882))

### The six steps to successful writing

#### Separate and interlocking tasks

There are three main bottlenecks for productivity.

Attention:

The goal is to maximize our attention and our [focus](/notes/focus.md). This requires us to first acknowledge and try to limit any [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md). A famous unknown distraction is [planning](/notes/planning.md), when we focus too much on planning we are delaying the process of actual learning. The moment we stop planning and start doing we begin to learn. Doing is the only way to achieve [mastery](/notes/mastery.md) because each experience helps us develop our [intuition](/notes/intuition.md) which is the bedrock of expertise. 

Then we need to stop [multitasking](/notes/multitasking-doesnt-exist.md), because it only hurts our ability to concentrate fully on each task. Starting to focus on a task is called *focused attention*, but what we hope to achieve is *sustained attention*, where focusing is no longer difficult to do, when we achieve a sense of flow.

Memory:

Things are easier to memories and perform the smaller they are [start small](/notes/start-small.md). We can reduce the size of information by [chunking](/notes/chunking.md) it, which means separate it into smaller pieces and provide context to each piece to make it memorable. For example, a random collection of numbers is hard to memorize, but easier if we divide it into sets of numbers that can become someone's telephone number. 

When we create new notes, by connecting them to other notes we make them easier to remember, because we provide the context [Mental Shortcuts](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md) that will help us remember it later on.

Additionally, having smaller tasks helps us avoid the [zeigarnik effect](/notes/attention-residue.md) (unfinished tasks linger in our minds)

Willpower:

Since willpower is limited, the best way to preserve it is to make fewer decisions. Having less choices means we need to spend less of our willpower to progress. Having a system with clear templates, process and goal gives us a framework to use when making notes, with less decisions each time we write. 

:::note[Separate and Interlocking Tasks]

- The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1003))
- Instead of forcing ourselves to do something we don’t feel like doing, we need to find a way to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along. ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1126))

:::


#### Read for understanding

We have to read with intent, like how we understand text better when we write it by hand instead of typing it [learning should be hard](/notes/learning-should-be-hard.md). The goal is to avoid [conformation bias](/notes/conformation-bias.md) and instead focusing on what enriches our vault. What either connects or could be connected to other ideas? What makes the discussion in the vault more detailed and deep?

Learning is a form of [deliberate practice](/notes/deliberate-practice.md), which means it takes both effort and time. The more we read intently, the more we try to distill books and resources into their core ideas, the better we would be at it [practice beats perfection](/notes/practice-beats-perfection.md).

:::note[Read for Understanding]

- The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1257))
- The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative. ([Location 1402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1402))
- Take Smart Notes ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1405))
- real thinking requires some kind of externalization, especially in the form of writing. ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1484))
- information, like on a hard disk, but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information ([Location 1579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1579))

:::


#### Take smart notes

Writing turns the value of the slip box into a [compounding](/notes/compounding.md) one. The more notes we have, the exponentially better the box is. Writing also improves our ability to understand ideas because it gives us both the space [Empty Space](/notes/blank-space.md) and the distance [zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md) needed to understand and think critically about complex ideas. Therefore we learn through writing.

Another key aspect in learning is [Forgetfulness](/notes/forgetfulness.md), to remember everything is to be filled with noise, unable to detect the core message. Filtering out irrelevant information is key, but how can we know what is relevant and what is not? Our mind consider the information that has more cues to be more relevant, because it is more likely we will need it again someday. In the slip box method, more cues means more connections to other notes. That's why the value of an idea is mostly the amount of connections it has to other ideas.

#### develop ideas

Ideas starts from making connections, and that's why it is important to invest in them. First of all, the topic of the note is rarely a keyword within the note, but rather the broader context of what you are researching, for example a topic about heuristics can be as much part of economics, psychology or productivity depending on your focus.

Second, remember to invest in your note-to-note links, this helps you develop the external system and your internal knowledge simultaneously. By creating links we can detect patterns, which will be easier to remember. 

Linking can also help you improve your [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md) because connecting ideas is the underlying concept of creativity. [creativity](/notes/transferred-learning.md) requires abstract thinking, to reduce ideas to their core essence, separated from the context and method in which they were captured [medium independent](/notes/medium-independent.md), to compare, combine and test. Only simple ideas can be combined in such a way, that is the benefit of having a system that distill ideas to a simple concept, which can be later used as a basis for a more complex idea, built on top of many notes. 

Another contributing factor for creativity is [standartization](/notes/limits.md), by having a clear and rigid structure to our notes, we first reduce the amount of [decision points](/notes/decision-points.md) we make when writing, while also making it easier to add new content or use existing one because it is in the same format, like how languages have clear grammar rules that helps us communicate better with fewer words. 

:::note[Develop Ideas]

- Notes are only as valuable as the note and reference networks they are embedded in. ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1680))
- Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation. ([Location 1734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1734))
- we co-evolve with our slip-boxes: we build the same connections in our heads while we deliberately develop them in our slip-box – and make it easier to remember the facts as they now have a latticework we can attach them to. ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1851))

:::


#### Share your insights

Writing an article or a book suddenly becomes much easier thanks to the bottom up approach:
1. **Deciding on a topic** - instead of searching for a topic to write about, we can just take a look at which topics resurface and have a large base of related notes in our slip-box. Additionally, the content of these topics could be converted into an article because we know it came from such a source already. We will also be more motivated to write on whatever sparks our passion, which is probably what we are already reading and writing about.
2. **Making small decisions** - by writing every day, we have already noted which ideas are worth being written on, and we already have created a basis for an article so we don't need to start from scratch. 

When planning how long your writing will take, remember that [first batch trash](/notes/first-batch-trash.md), our first draft will always be sub-par, and that it will probably take more time than we estimate [planning fallacy](/notes/planning-fallacy.md)

#### Make it a habit

Writing should be a habit, we should replace our old habits with better one, and it starts with something as simple as carrying a pen and paper wherever you go, so that you could capture content quickly
