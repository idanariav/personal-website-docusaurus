<p>🔈 <em>Summary of main ideas</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>interdisciplinary</strong> - Women's oppressions as an object is a combination of biological, physiological and economical traits that have led to their social inferiority.</li>
<li><strong>Path dependence</strong> - Since biological traits were more relevant during historical times, men had a "head start" on shaping the world in their image, creating institutions, cultures and myths to prolong women's social inferiority, and even convince them of that.</li>
<li><strong>Myths</strong> - The social inferiority of women has been fixated through myths, that tie woman to nature, something mystical, scary and "animalistic", while man portrayed themselves as advanced beings, conquering both nature and women simultaneously in the quest of human transcendence.</li>
<li><strong>Liberation starts with economics</strong> - the main factor limiting women nowadays is economical power. Since the labor force is no longer dependent on biological traits, there is no reason for women not to join the workforce and developing a career. By doing that, they have the ability to gain economical freedom, no longer dependent on men. This change is the first step in the process of liberation, that must include also social, moral and phycological change towards women, that we give them control on the narrative, allowing the possibility of breaking preexisting myths, as we see in our modern times.</li>
<li><strong>outsourced transcendence</strong> - since women are synonymous with nature (according to men), they can't transcend it. Therefore many women "double down" on becoming an object, seeking control of the household as their "freedom", treat external appearance as internal expression, and compete with other women for men's attention. All this to say that their transcendence is dependent on external approval, i.e to be accepted by men, creating total dependence. While men are free to fulfill their will to transcend existence, not needing anyone's approval, seeing women as a small part of their life.</li>
<li><strong>what is a woman</strong> - honestly it is hard to say. Much of women's behavior, situation and character has been developed either directly by, or as a response to men's oppression. Until true freedom is achieved, we will not know what is the true meaning of being a woman.</li>

<p>⛓ <em>Life lessons, action items</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>let their voices heard</strong> - Women's involvement in all parts of life, from our political to the economical state should include women as active, equal and self representing voice.</li>
<li><strong>Break preexisting myths</strong> - introspect on what you believe it is true, and even if it doesn't seem related, ask yourself whether this value was created by and for the enslavement of women.</li>

<p>✅ <em>by following this method, what will happen?</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Men's invisible hand</strong> - you will see the "invisible hand" of preexisting patriarchy through myths and institutions that limit women's freedom and place them in a physiological prison, even in cases where it is of their own making</li>
<li><strong>What is the true default</strong> - you will see that up until now, to be human was understood as to be male. Societies norms, expectations, and values are all set by and for men, but worse of all they are perceived as if representing the entire humanity, while in reality a whole different set of norms and values of women is being silenced, oppressed and opposed.</li>
</ol>
<p>❌ <em>the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...</em></p>
<p>🧱 <em>Implementations and limitations of it are...</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>outdated</strong> - it is fortunate to say that much has changed from the 1940s, and that many of the aspects described in the book are less common, or even non existent. Not only this means that some sections of the book are less relevant, it also means that it lacks the more modern aspects of what it means to be a woman, the challenges they are facing, and how they interacts with the "male world".</li>

<p>💭 <em>my opinions on the book, the writers style...</em></p>
<ol>
<li>there is a tendency to provide all available examples to the situation of women around the world, instead of focusing on establishing an argument and connecting in to the general message of the book. Meaning that it is often repetitive and over elaborated, However in most case this elaboration is eye opening and enriching, showing just how thorough De Beauvoir is.</li>

<p><strong>In our culture, to be a man is to be the default,</strong> the positive and the neutral definition of humanity. It is the focal point, and everything else is defines relative to a man. To be a woman, is to detract several capabilities from a man, i.e to be defined relative to him, while he is to defined relative to her.</p>
<p>It is because we, as humans, quickly divide ourselves into groups of <a href=/docs/notes/us-vs-them>us vs them</a>. The process of self defining requires creating an "other".
While the "we" (aka "one") group are more characterized by <a href=/docs/notes/subjectivity>subjectivity</a>, as a capable, moral, transcendent being, the other is described as <a href=/docs/notes/objectivity>objectivity</a>, as a lesser form, less deserving of rights and privileges.</p>
<p>While in most cases, both groups tend to accept themselves as the "one", while the other group is the "other". Women have agreed to this hierarchy and also define themselves as "other", they have accepted their objectivity.</p>
<p>Similarly, while other cases can "imagine a world" where the other disappears, where there is only "us", it cannot be the case for women. "Unfortunately", women are half of a whole who two components are needed for one another. I.e she is bound to a relationship with her oppressor.</p>
<p>These relationship is not equal. <strong>While men feels independent of women, women have internalized their need for men</strong>. Similarly, men hold all the power in the relationship, usually through economical and political means. To demand equality would be an act of war, especially for men who are most insecure about their position in life.</p>
<p><strong>It is a self fulfilling prophecy, that men use their power to make women inferior, and then justify their inferiority based on the situation they have created</strong> <a href=/docs/notes/is-vs-ought>Is vs Ought</a>. Like forcing a black person to be only a shoe-shine, and then justifying their inferiority by saying "look, they are only good for shining shoes".</p>

<p>At first, at least in the theoretical sense, while humanity was still in it's infancy, no more than mere animals, there was a balance between the sexes. the balance of male production and female reproduction did not naturally lead to one dominating the other, since both were equally valuable to society.</p>
<p>However, <strong>as humanity developed, there was the urge to surpass nature, to transcend from our animalistic nature and become something more. Not only survival, but domination and control over nature</strong>. it is only in surpassing the animal condition that humans can find meaning—by defining their own humanity as separate from the existence of animals.</p>
<p>This is the point of separation, because from the point of view of transcendence women’s role in producing children entails a simple, passive submission to biological necessity, one that even animals can perform, a mere maintenance of the status quo, of adhering to natural tendencies. However, men’s role in inventing new things and asserting their power over their environment surpasses the capacities of animals and allows men to recognize their own humanity and their future potential, they create value for society, they helped humanity advance.</p>
<p><strong>Based on this narrative, women are the same as nature, the thing we as humans try to surpass, our enemy and weakness, while men are our transcendental being, the force of creativity and power to drive us forwards.</strong></p>

<p>certain societies associated women with childbirth, and worshipped women’s role in producing new life. However, she argues that even in these societies, woman was still considered an “Other;” she can only be worshipped in the first place because she is considered to be not a peer, but outside of the human order. This means that <strong>society has always been centered around men, rather than an equal consideration of both sexes</strong>. It also means that <strong>woman is still always defined by men</strong>: they created women as idols in the first place, and therefore can also destroy these idols. Furthermore, these female idols were based in male fear, not love or respect. <strong>Once agriculture gave way to creative labor, men could reclaim control over both children and crops, and women lost all power they may have had as idols</strong>. <a href=/notes/agricultural-revolution.md>agricultural revolution</a></p>

<li>Insofar as woman is considered the absolute Other, that is—whatever magic powers she has—as the inessential, it is precisely impossible to regard her as another subject.3 Women have thus never constituted a separate group that posited itself for-itself before a male group; they have never had a direct or autonomous relationship with men. “The relationship of reciprocity which is the basis of marriage is not established between men and women, but between men by means of women, who are merely the occasion of this relationship,” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1717" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Location 1717</a>)</li>

<li>Thus, the triumph of patriarchy was neither an accident nor the result of a violent revolution. From the origins of humanity, their biological privilege enabled men to affirm themselves alone as sovereign subjects; they never abdicated this privilege; they alienated part of their existence in Nature and in Woman; but they won it back afterward; condemned to play the role of the Other, woman was thus condemned to possess no more than precarious power: slave or idol, she was never the one who chose her lot.

<p>After the agricultural revolution, private property became a human concept. No more hunter gatherers who share everything, since they don't own anything, but rather societies with permanent settlements that can gather and create property. With this shift, <strong>women were defined as property as well</strong>, which led men to value sexual fidelity. If a woman was not a virgin or faithful to her husband, his ability to pass on his property to his own children would be threatened.</p>

<p>She analyzes Christian demonization of sexuality as the root of its discrimination against women, who represent a temptation. She also describes Germanic traditions in which women are respected and well treated under the law as long as they remain man’s property and give up individual right.</p>
<p>over time the position of privileged women did change. In the Italian Renaissance, individualism became celebrated across both sexes. Women could join in freethinking activities and sponsor the arts, or run their own salons. However, they were only allowed to participate in such cultural activities because these did not tangibly change the political landscape.</p>
<p>Overall, de Beauvoir concludes that <strong>democratic and individualist ideals of the 18th century did somewhat help women’s position in society</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>the French Revolution did not actually change the fate of women</strong>. It was run by men and focused on bourgeois values, leaving working class women behind. In the anarchic phase of the revolution, women enjoyed some kind of freedom, but this ended when society was reorganized.</p>
<p>By contrast, the reform movement of the 19th century did seek justice in equality, though Proudhon proved an exception. These movements tended to recognize that women were most exploited by the capitalist system.</p>
<p>de Beauvoir also considers the dilemma of balancing reproductive work with productive work. <strong>Women’s fertility was variously controlled by the state over the course of history</strong>. Christian morals helped to make abortion a crime, which in turn forced women to focus more on reproduction than production in the labor force. In the 19th century, being able to work and having more freedom to control their reproduction helped change women’s condition. Nevertheless, the feminist movement advanced slowly because of the class divisions that split the women involved.</p>
<p><strong>circumstances have prevented women from rising to their potential greatness, and reiterates that women need both abstract rights and concrete possibilities in order to have true freedom to create</strong>. The burdens of marriage are still heavier on women, since it is more difficult to balance work with domestic duties. However, marriage still represents the best way to advance a woman’s situation, which means women turn to marriage over advancing in their careers, thus perpetuating the cycle of less skilled women workers. <strong>Women thus have to exert greater “moral effort” to choose independence, since the path of independence is more difficult for them than it is for men</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Woman is perceived as nature</strong>. Nature that both takes and gives life. <strong>It is an inseparable part of what it means to be alive, but it is also the one thing we wish to surpass</strong>. This duality has shaped the relationship between men and women. Men cannot escape his destiny of life and death, but nevertheless he wishes to surpass it. He treats woman as something to be adored but also feared at the same time. Mother nature, Death itself, darkness, treacherous of the sea, all represented by women.</p>
<p>This also makes transcendence easier for man. Instead of working internally on rejecting and assimilating "being" at the same time <a href=/docs/books/ethics-of-ambiguity-book>Ethics of ambiguity (book)</a> , <strong>he outsources his transcendence to women. By controlling, surpassing women, he believes he can transcend himself and nature</strong>.
By being her educator, her benefactor, and even has her tyrant, he transcends himself through her, like parents who wishes to fulfill their own dreams using their children.</p>
<p>That is why on the one hand, when the men "owns" his woman, he wishes her to appear at her "best self", to highlight her "natural" features, mainly her body. <strong>The more "natural" she appears, the stronger his rule over nature</strong>. Similarly, that is why she is in charge of all the "natural" aspects of day to day living in the household, such as taking care of food, raising the children, basic chores. All these are a continuation of her as a representor of nature, while men is "out there" pursuing dreams and aspirations, fulfilling a higher calling, in his road to transcendence, while she remains in the low, natural state of living.
But on the other hand, <strong>when she is not yet "yours" to conquer, she is a threat</strong>. Her sexuality has to be hidden, she is a devil, a force of temptation and corruption, i.e the negative aspects of nature and "earthly desires". Therefore she should be controlled, tamed, reduced to a mere servant, to be similar to man, a pure soul in servitude of his god, being guided by him.</p>

<p><strong>One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman</strong>. <a href=/docs/notes/social-construct>Social Construct</a>
Nothing in our biology suggests that female should be grown up to be women. Children from both sexes act similarly during their early years.</p>
<p><strong>It is when we, parents, family, society, start to treat those two differently, that we educate them to be "man" and "woman".</strong> When we stop "pampering" the boys, telling them to be strong, to be independent.
When we let girls play only with dolls, showing them that their job is to take care, to put others first.</p>
<p>adults value and praise a boy’s sexuality in compensation for his earlier weaning; this teaches him to identify his sexuality with his independence and transcendence. On the other hand, girls’ sexuality is neither praised nor acknowledged, which leaves them more confused and often leads them to wish they were boys.
While boys have an "inherent" device that symbolizes their transcendence (their penis), girls don't have that, so they are forced to seek transcendence through others, whether by playing with dolls (being a care taker) or seeking the attention of adults, both cases they are becoming an object.</p>
<p>As they enter puberty, women are given responsibilities in the house earlier on than boys. However, they learn that women are limited to these kinds of chores. Thus, <strong>although they might mature faster, they are also stuck in this state for the rest of their lives, while boys get to explore and grow over time</strong>. At the same time, they are taught to approach love by submitting to the will of men. sex and puberty are associated with shame and pain.</p>

<p><strong>While women are for men only one factor in a complete life, for women, men and marriage are the only goal they can aspire to</strong>. Just as boys start to develop more aggressive games in adolescence, girls are encouraged to become more passive. de Beauvoir claims that their awareness of their physical weakness leads them to lose confidence in everything else about themselves.</p>
<p><strong>They also begin to think of themselves as objects and become obsessed with their own appearance, because this is the only thing men care about when they approach women</strong>. They grow up to be confused because they are divided between accepting their feminine destiny to be passive, and rebelling against it.</p>

<p><strong>marriage remains unequal for women because it represents the only way for a girl to enter into society and be economically secure, while boys do not face the same pressure because they can work and live independently</strong>. Wives are expected to serve their husbands and take care of the house and children, instead of having their own interests or lives outside of the home. The wife can only interact with society through her husband, and has no sense of independence or future</p>
<p>women are often very conflicted about marriage because it is both beneficial and harmful to them. They often marry because they think they should, and end up in situations they did not expect. Because no one talks to them about what to expect, either from married life or from losing their virginity, many women feel violated by their first sexual experience with their husbands, and continue to feel miserable in their sexual relations. <strong>Most men are not in love with their wives, but rather think of them as property</strong>. Love and marriage generally do not go together for either gender because marriage is an oppressive and unequal institution.</p>
<p><strong>To compensate for their lack of freedom outside the house, women often become domineering within the space of the home</strong> and fixate completely on housework. However, this work is largely meaningless because it does not create anything new or contribute to society, leaving women unhappy and unfulfilled overall.</p>

<li>The wife is not allowed to do any positive work and consequently to have herself known as a complete person. Regardless of how well she is respected, she is subjugated, secondary, parasitic. The heavy curse weighing on her is that the very meaning of her existence is not in her hands. This is the reason the successes and failures of her conjugal life have much more importance for her than for the man: he is a citizen, a producer, before being a husband; she is above all, and often exclusively, a wife; (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=9569" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Location 9569</a>)</li>
<li>In a struggle where her intellectual shortcomings condemn her to losing every time, the young wife has no defense other than silence, or tears, or violence: (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=9823" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Location 9823</a>)</li>

<li>the woman wants to “hold on to” her husband as well as to refuse his domination. She struggles against him to defend her autonomy, and she fights against the rest of the world to conserve the “situation” that dooms her to dependence.

<p>for women, becoming a mother means fulfilling their natural duty, but it is not true transcendence since it is according to nature, and not from surpassing what is “natural.”</p>
<p><strong>women feel ambivalent about childbirth because it represents new life, but also the eventuality of their own death</strong>. Pregnancy can be fulfilling for certain women in all the wrong ways: they might feel like they finally have a purpose in life, but this is a dangerous mindset because, of course, pregnancy cannot last forever and thus cannot always provide women with a purpose. Often, women can be disappointed when the child is finally born and is not everything they expected it to be.</p>
<p>Some women can think of children as their double, or their reason for existing. This can become complicated as children get older because they develop their individuality and often disappoint their mothers. Motherhood can be positive if women approach it in a healthy way and do not expect their love to be reciprocated in the same way they offer it.</p>
<p>Mothers are likely to try to control and limit their sons, while thinking of their daughters as their doubles and relating to them more closely. However, when either a son or daughter attempts to be independent of their mother, women can react negatively and try to stop this process. Thus, <strong>the oppression of women is negative both for women and for their children</strong>.</p>

<p>marriage also limits women’s abilities to function in society. She claims that women can only try to show off and represent themselves to others in society, instead of having genuine connections with others. They express themselves through their wardrobes, which are often restrictive of movement and are designed only to make women appear attractive and limited. <strong>Women’s clothes are so important because women are essentially thought of as decorative objects</strong>. <a href=/docs/notes/form-vs-essence>form vs essence</a>.</p>
<p>women often feel a rivalry with other women, since they are all competing for men’s attention, and this destroys women’s ability to remain true friends with one another. Adultery and women’s relationships with lovers are also shaped by their lack of freedom within their marriages; women often have lovers in order to take revenge on their husbands.</p>

<p><strong>most women fear aging because they depend on their appearance to get by in society</strong>. Old women are often faced with regrets, as well; they reflect back on a youth in which they were not able to accomplish anything beyond marriage and are generally frustrated with their situation. However, in some ways old age allows women greater freedom. They do not associate themselves as much with their physical bodies, and live more in their imaginations. Nevertheless, <strong>their situation remains tragic because they only gain these freedoms once they are too old to make use of them</strong>.</p>
<p>at this age, women place all of their hopes on their children and expect to live vicariously through them. This can be a negative situation for both the older mother and her child, as it is frustrating for both of them when the child wants to be more independent.</p>

<p><strong>woman’s situation has remained largely the same throughout history, leaving her oppressed and unequal when compared to men</strong>. This means that her character has also remained mostly the same throughout history, since a woman’s character is shaped by her social situation. Woman’s character is described as: argumentative, petty, weak, immoral, selfish, and deceptive. However, women are like this because they must accept masculine authority, and this leads to many contradictions in their personalities and outlooks on life. Most of their faults are related to the fact that their opportunities are very limited. For this reason, <strong>much of feminine behavior should be interpreted as a protest against the masculine order</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>narcissism is an attitude that emerges from women’s oppressive social situation</strong>. Narcissism is a process of alienation, in which women view themselves as an object and place supreme value on their physical being. <strong>Since women cannot exist as subjects themselves, so they seek transcendence by losing themselves in something else. For some women, this “something else” is the object that they represent in society</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>They want to be recognized as important by those around them because they have no important skills or products to offer the world, besides the bare fact of their existence</strong>. These kinds of women never build genuine connections with others because they insist on being the center of everyone’s existence and do not truly know themselves or the reality around them. Although narcissists may appear strong and self-absorbed, they are actually weak because their entire self-worth depends on how important they are to others.</p>

<p>omen in love can also lose themselves fully in their love affairs without being truly understood. <strong>Love is all-consuming for women; they devote themselves entirely to pleasing the man they love. However, for men, love is just another piece of their lives</strong>, as opposed to their entire existence. Women will inevitably be disappointed by their lovers because they expect too much of them. <strong>By putting the beloved man on a pedestal, a woman sets herself up to be devastated when that man acts human and appears flawed</strong>. At the same time, there is another contradiction inherent in women’s love for men: they want men to be godlike but they also want to possess them entirely. Similarly, women want to give themselves up entirely to men but also want men to fully appreciate this sacrifice and give them access to the world through their love. de Beauvoir believes that many women find self-worth only through the fact that a man loves them.</p>
<p>When a love affair is broken off, a woman often finds herself completely ruined. She not only loses economic benefits, but also feels like she has lost her entire purpose for living. On the other hand, men can usually recover more easily from the end of an affair because their affairs do not give them purpose in life.</p>

<p>women have more rights and are allowed to work and claim independence; however, these civic liberties are only abstract if economic autonomy is not also in place. <strong>Women still face a greater burden when they try to work outside of the home, because they remain economically disadvantaged, dependent on husbands, or limited by the extra work required of them at home.</strong> Women can only achieve total freedom while working if she is in a socialist society. Overall, women have only come “halfway” in terms of achieving true equality and independence because they still face extra challenges. For example, their femininity often contradicts their work. The more productive a woman is in society, the less “feminine” she is considered to be, and vice versa. For example, a woman who is considered dominant or intelligent can seem threatening or undesirable as a romantic prospect for men. For women who want to remain feminine while still pursuing their independent work, this presents a difficult dilemma.</p>
<p>Sex presents a contradiction for women who want to be independent, because the dynamics involved often subordinate women to men. For example, men are typically more dominant and initiate the encounter. This can seem like a threat to an independent woman’s sense of autonomy, however. Therefore, relations with men can complicate a woman’s ability to be productive and feel positive about her position in society.
Overall, an independent woman in de Beauvoir’s day was torn between her profession and her sexual life.</p>

<p>I women can exist for themselves, they can continue to exist for men as well and both men and women can find greater satisfaction in love. Romantic relations are the basis for interactions between the two genders, in all spheres of life. The most exalted of human emotions, love, might become even more important and fulfilling if women were better treated throughout society.</p>
