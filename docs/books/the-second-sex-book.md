## ‚úíÔ∏è Note-Making

### üí°Clarify
üîà *Summary of main ideas*
1. **interdisciplinary** - Women's oppressions as an object is a combination of biological, physiological and economical traits that have led to their social inferiority.
2. **Path dependence** - Since biological traits were more relevant during historical times, men had a "head start" on shaping the world in their image, creating institutions, cultures and myths to prolong women's social inferiority, and even convince them of that.
3. **Myths** - The social inferiority of women has been fixated through myths, that tie woman to nature, something mystical, scary and "animalistic", while man portrayed themselves as advanced beings, conquering both nature and women simultaneously in the quest of human transcendence.
4. **Liberation starts with economics** - the main factor limiting women nowadays is economical power. Since the labor force is no longer dependent on biological traits, there is no reason for women not to join the workforce and developing a career. By doing that, they have the ability to gain economical freedom, no longer dependent on men. This change is the first step in the process of liberation, that must include also social, moral and phycological change towards women, that we give them control on the narrative, allowing the possibility of breaking preexisting myths, as we see in our modern times.
5. **outsourced transcendence** - since women are synonymous with nature (according to men), they can't transcend it. Therefore many women "double down" on becoming an object, seeking control of the household as their "freedom", treat external appearance as internal expression, and compete with other women for men's attention. All this to say that their transcendence is dependent on external approval, i.e to be accepted by men, creating total dependence. While men are free to fulfill their will to transcend existence, not needing anyone's approval, seeing women as a small part of their life.
6. **what is a woman** - honestly it is hard to say. Much of women's behavior, situation and character has been developed either directly by, or as a response to men's oppression. Until true freedom is achieved, we will not know what is the true meaning of being a woman.

### üóíÔ∏èRelate

‚õì *Life lessons, action items*
1. **let their voices heard** - Women's involvement in all parts of life, from our political to the economical state should include women as active, equal and self representing voice.
2. **Break preexisting myths** - introspect on what you believe it is true, and even if it doesn't seem related, ask yourself whether this value was created by and for the enslavement of women.
### üîçCritique

‚úÖ *by following this method, what will happen?*
1. **Men's invisible hand** - you will see the "invisible hand" of preexisting patriarchy through myths and institutions that limit women's freedom and place them in a physiological prison, even in cases where it is of their own making
2. **What is the true default** - you will see that up until now, to be human was understood as to be male. Societies norms, expectations, and values are all set by and for men, but worse of all they are perceived as if representing the entire humanity, while in reality a whole different set of norms and values of women is being silenced, oppressed and opposed.

‚ùå *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*

üß± *Implementations and limitations of it are...*
1. **outdated** - it is fortunate to say that much has changed from the 1940s, and that many of the aspects described in the book are less common, or even non existent. Not only this means that some sections of the book are less relevant, it also means that it lacks the more modern aspects of what it means to be a woman, the challenges they are facing, and how they interacts with the "male world".

### üó®Ô∏èReview

üí≠ *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
1. there is a tendency to provide all available examples to the situation of women around the world, instead of focusing on establishing an argument and connecting in to the general message of the book. Meaning that it is often repetitive and over elaborated, However in most case this elaboration is eye opening and enriching, showing just how thorough De Beauvoir is.

## üìí Notes

### Part 1 - Facts and Myths

#### Introduction

**In our culture, to be a man is to be the default,** the positive and the neutral definition of humanity. It is the focal point, and everything else is defines relative to a man. To be a woman, is to detract several capabilities from a man, i.e to be defined relative to him, while he is to defined relative to her.

It is because we, as humans, quickly divide ourselves into groups of [us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md). The process of self defining requires creating an "other".
While the "we" (aka "one") group are more characterized by [subjectivity](/notes/subjectivity.md), as a capable, moral, transcendent being, the other is described as [objectivity](/notes/objectivity.md), as a lesser form, less deserving of rights and privileges.

While in most cases, both groups tend to accept themselves as the "one", while the other group is the "other". Women have agreed to this hierarchy and also define themselves as "other", they have accepted their objectivity.

Similarly, while other cases can "imagine a world" where the other disappears, where there is only "us", it cannot be the case for women. "Unfortunately", women are half of a whole who two components are needed for one another. I.e she is bound to a relationship with her oppressor.

These relationship is not equal. **While men feels independent of women, women have internalized their need for men**. Similarly, men hold all the power in the relationship, usually through economical and political means. To demand equality would be an act of war, especially for men who are most insecure about their position in life.

**It is a self fulfilling prophecy, that men use their power to make women inferior, and then justify their inferiority based on the situation they have created** [Is vs Ought](/notes/is-vs-ought.md). Like forcing a black person to be only a shoe-shine, and then justifying their inferiority by saying "look, they are only good for shining shoes".

:::note[Quotes]

- Is femininity secreted by the ovaries? Is it enshrined in a Platonic heaven? Is a frilly petticoat enough to bring it down to earth? Although some women zealously strive to embody it, the model has never been patented. ([Location¬†330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=330))
- Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself; she is not considered an autonomous being. ([Location¬†370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=370))
- She is determined and differentiated in relation to man, while he is not in relation to her; she is the inessential in front of the essential. He is the Subject; he is the Absolute. She is the Other. ([Location¬†375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=375))
- No group ever defines itself as One without immediately setting up the Other opposite itself. ([Location¬†381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=381))
- the subject posits itself only in opposition; it asserts itself as the essential and sets up the other as inessential, as the object. ([Location¬†391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=391))
- it is not the Other who, defining itself as Other, defines the One; the Other is posited as Other by the One positing itself as One. But in order for the Other not to turn into the One, the Other has to submit to this foreign point of view. Where does this submission in woman come from? ([Location¬†398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=398))
- If woman discovers herself as the inessential and never turns into the essential, it is because she does not bring about this transformation herself. ([Location¬†412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=412))
- This is the fundamental characteristic of woman: she is the Other at the heart of a whole whose two components are necessary to each other. ([Location¬†427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=427))
- in the master-slave relation, the master does not posit the need he has for the other; he holds the power to satisfy this need and does not mediate it; the slave, on the other hand, out of dependence, hope, or fear, internalizes his need for the master; ([Location¬†435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=435))
- Refusing to be the Other, refusing complicity with man, would mean renouncing all the advantages an alliance with the superior caste confers on them. ([Location¬†446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=446))
- no one is more arrogant toward women, more aggressive or more disdainful, than a man anxious about his own virility. ([Location¬†520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=520))
- she discovers and chooses herself in a world where men force her to assume herself as Other: an attempt is made to freeze her as an object and doom her to immanence, since her transcendence will be forever transcended by another essential and sovereign consciousness.

### Part 2 - DESTINY
#### Biological Data

What is the nature of different sexes in the animal world? the distinction is not as clear and simple as it seems. when considering evolutionary theory, neither biological system can be called ‚Äúsuperior.‚Äù **The biological differences between the sexes within the human world doesn't entails a certain destiny**, for example, being a child barer doesn't mean that female should be the care takers of the children. Biology is not enough to explain why woman is ‚Äúthe Other‚Äù in society, because we as humans have already surpassed nature in many aspects, therefore **our social, and economical context is much more relevant when we analyze women's situation than biology**. [nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md)

:::note[Quotes]

- she is the most deeply alienated of all the female mammals, and she is the one that refuses this alienation the most violently; in no other is the subordination of the organism to the reproductive function more imperious nor accepted with greater difficulty. ([Location¬†1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1068))
- the woman‚Äôs body is one of the essential elements of the situation she occupies in this world. But her body is not enough to define her; it has a lived reality only as taken on by consciousness through actions and within a society; biology alone cannot provide an answer to the question that concerns us: why is woman the Other? The question is how, in her, nature has been taken on in the course of history; the question is what humanity has made of the human female. ([Location¬†1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1153))

:::


#### The Psychoanalytical Point of View

Women feel inferior to men, they envy men and judge themselves based on the male standard. But in contrast with other thinkers who tie this feeling to women's subconscious, de Beauvoir ties it to society [Narratives](/notes/narratives.md). **Society, not their own subconscious, teaches them to feel this way**

:::note[Quotes]

- Nature does not define woman: it is she who defines herself by reclaiming nature for herself in her affectivity. ([Location¬†1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1174))
- Deprived of this alter ego, the little girl does not alienate herself in a graspable thing, does not reclaim herself: she is thus led to make her entire self an object, to posit herself as the Other; the question of knowing whether or not she has compared herself with boys is secondary; what is important is that, even without her knowing it, the absence of a penis keeps her from being aware of herself as a sex; ([Location¬†1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1338))
- Psychoanalysis could only find its truth within a historical context. ([Location¬†1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1346))

:::


#### The Point of View of Historical Materialism

It is not economical reasons alone that have led women into their inferior state, although it is a large part of it. It stems from **the human quest towards transcendence, and specifically the transcendence of nature that has lead to the separation between the sexes**, that had shaped the world in men's image, which one of it's aspects is difference in economical power. [materialism](/notes/materialism.md)

:::note[Quotes]

- Humanity is not an animal species: it is a historical reality. Human society is an anti-physis: it does not passively submit to the presence of nature, but rather appropriates it. ([Location¬†1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1418))
- woman cannot simply be considered a sexed organism: among biological data, only those with concrete value in action have any importance; woman‚Äôs consciousness of herself is not defined by her sexuality alone: it reflects a situation that depends on society‚Äôs economic structure, a structure that indicates the degree of technical evolution humanity has attained. ([Location¬†1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1420))
- her social oppression is the consequence of her economic oppression. Equality can only be reestablished when both sexes have equal legal rights; ([Location¬†1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1448))
- the division of labor by sex might have been a friendly association. If the original relation between man and his peers had been exclusively one of friendship, one could not account for any kind of enslavement: this phenomenon is a consequence of the imperialism of human consciousness, which seeks to match its sovereignty objectively. Had there not been in human consciousness both the original category of the Other and an original claim to domination over the Other, the discovery of the bronze tool could not have brought about woman‚Äôs oppression. ([Location¬†1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1491))
- be compelled in the way a freedom can be. There is no way to directly oblige a woman to give birth: all that can be done is to enclose her in situations where motherhood is her only option: laws or customs impose marriage on her, anticonception measures and abortion are banned, divorce is forbidden. ([Location¬†1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1515))
- Underlying the personal emotional conflicts as well as the economic history of humanity there is an existential infrastructure that alone makes it possible to understand in its unity the unique form that is a life. ([Location¬†1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1532))

### Part 3 - HISTORY
#### CHAPTER 1

At first, at least in the theoretical sense, while humanity was still in it's infancy, no more than mere animals, there was a balance between the sexes. the balance of male production and female reproduction did not naturally lead to one dominating the other, since both were equally valuable to society.

However, **as humanity developed, there was the urge to surpass nature, to transcend from our animalistic nature and become something more. Not only survival, but domination and control over nature**. it is only in surpassing the animal condition that humans can find meaning‚Äîby defining their own humanity as separate from the existence of animals.

This is the point of separation, because from the point of view of transcendence women‚Äôs role in producing children entails a simple, passive submission to biological necessity, one that even animals can perform, a mere maintenance of the status quo, of adhering to natural tendencies. However, men‚Äôs role in inventing new things and asserting their power over their environment surpasses the capacities of animals and allows men to recognize their own humanity and their future potential, they create value for society, they helped humanity advance.

**Based on this narrative, women are the same as nature, the thing we as humans try to surpass, our enemy and weakness, while men are our transcendental being, the force of creativity and power to drive us forwards.**

:::note[Quotes]

- This world has always belonged to males, and none of the reasons given for this have ever seemed sufficient. ([Location¬†1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1550))
- as robust as women may have been at that time, the burdens of reproduction represented for them a severe handicap in the fight against a hostile world: ([Location¬†1565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1565))
- The worst curse on woman is her exclusion from warrior expeditions; it is not in giving life but in risking his life that man raises himself above the animal; this is why throughout humanity, superiority has been granted not to the sex that gives birth but to the one that kills.

- The female, more than the male, is prey to the species; humanity has always tried to escape from its species‚Äô destiny; with the invention of the tool, maintenance of life became activity and project for man, while motherhood left woman riveted to her body like the animal.

- Male activity, creating values, has constituted existence itself as a value; it has prevailed over the indistinct forces of life; and it has subjugated Nature and Woman. ([Location¬†1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1630))

#### CHAPTER 2

certain societies associated women with childbirth, and worshipped women‚Äôs role in producing new life. However, she argues that even in these societies, woman was still considered an ‚ÄúOther;‚Äù she can only be worshipped in the first place because she is considered to be not a peer, but outside of the human order. This means that **society has always been centered around men, rather than an equal consideration of both sexes**. It also means that **woman is still always defined by men**: they created women as idols in the first place, and therefore can also destroy these idols. Furthermore, these female idols were based in male fear, not love or respect. **Once agriculture gave way to creative labor, men could reclaim control over both children and crops, and women lost all power they may have had as idols**. [agricultural revolution](/notes/agricultural-revolution.md)

:::note[Quotes]

- Insofar as woman is considered the absolute Other, that is‚Äîwhatever magic powers she has‚Äîas the inessential, it is precisely impossible to regard her as another subject.3 Women have thus never constituted a separate group that posited itself for-itself before a male group; they have never had a direct or autonomous relationship with men. ‚ÄúThe relationship of reciprocity which is the basis of marriage is not established between men and women, but between men by means of women, who are merely the occasion of this relationship,‚Äù ([Location¬†1717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1717))
- The prestige she enjoys in the eyes of men comes from them; they kneel before the Other, they worship the Goddess Mother. But as powerful as she may appear, she is defined through notions created by the male consciousness. ([Location¬†1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1753))
- Thus, the triumph of patriarchy was neither an accident nor the result of a violent revolution. From the origins of humanity, their biological privilege enabled men to affirm themselves alone as sovereign subjects; they never abdicated this privilege; they alienated part of their existence in Nature and in Woman; but they won it back afterward; condemned to play the role of the Other, woman was thus condemned to possess no more than precarious power: slave or idol, she was never the one who chose her lot. ([Location¬†1811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1811))
- it is because she did not participate in his way of working and thinking and because she remained enslaved to the mysteries of life that the male did not recognize in her an equal; ([Location¬†1822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=1822))

:::

#### CHAPTER 3

After the agricultural revolution, private property became a human concept. No more hunter gatherers who share everything, since they don't own anything, but rather societies with permanent settlements that can gather and create property. With this shift, **women were defined as property as well**, which led men to value sexual fidelity. If a woman was not a virgin or faithful to her husband, his ability to pass on his property to his own children would be threatened.

:::note[Quotes]

- the Roman woman of the decline is typical of false emancipation, possessing, in a world where men are still the only masters, nothing but empty freedom: she is free ‚Äúfor nothing.‚Äù ([Location¬†2184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=2184))

:::

#### CHAPTER 4

She analyzes Christian demonization of sexuality as the root of its discrimination against women, who represent a temptation. She also describes Germanic traditions in which women are respected and well treated under the law as long as they remain man‚Äôs property and give up individual right.

over time the position of privileged women did change. In the Italian Renaissance, individualism became celebrated across both sexes. Women could join in freethinking activities and sponsor the arts, or run their own salons. However, they were only allowed to participate in such cultural activities because these did not tangibly change the political landscape.

Overall, de Beauvoir concludes that **democratic and individualist ideals of the 18th century did somewhat help women‚Äôs position in society**.

:::note[Quotes]

- In common law as in feudal law, the only emancipation is outside marriage; the daughter and the widow have the same capacities as the man; but by marrying, the woman falls under the husband‚Äôs guardianship and administration; ([Location¬†2309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=2309))

:::

#### CHAPTER 5

**the French Revolution did not actually change the fate of women**. It was run by men and focused on bourgeois values, leaving working class women behind. In the anarchic phase of the revolution, women enjoyed some kind of freedom, but this ended when society was reorganized.

By contrast, the reform movement of the 19th century did seek justice in equality, though Proudhon proved an exception. These movements tended to recognize that women were most exploited by the capitalist system.

de Beauvoir also considers the dilemma of balancing reproductive work with productive work. **Women‚Äôs fertility was variously controlled by the state over the course of history**. Christian morals helped to make abortion a crime, which in turn forced women to focus more on reproduction than production in the labor force. In the 19th century, being able to work and having more freedom to control their reproduction helped change women‚Äôs condition. Nevertheless, the feminist movement advanced slowly because of the class divisions that split the women involved.

**circumstances have prevented women from rising to their potential greatness, and reiterates that women need both abstract rights and concrete possibilities in order to have true freedom to create**. The burdens of marriage are still heavier on women, since it is more difficult to balance work with domestic duties. However, marriage still represents the best way to advance a woman‚Äôs situation, which means women turn to marriage over advancing in their careers, thus perpetuating the cycle of less skilled women workers. **Women thus have to exert greater ‚Äúmoral effort‚Äù to choose independence, since the path of independence is more difficult for them than it is for men**.

### Part 4 - MYTHS
#### CHAPTER 1

**Woman is perceived as nature**. Nature that both takes and gives life. **It is an inseparable part of what it means to be alive, but it is also the one thing we wish to surpass**. This duality has shaped the relationship between men and women. Men cannot escape his destiny of life and death, but nevertheless he wishes to surpass it. He treats woman as something to be adored but also feared at the same time. Mother nature, Death itself, darkness, treacherous of the sea, all represented by women.

This also makes transcendence easier for man. Instead of working internally on rejecting and assimilating "being" at the same time [Ethics of ambiguity (book)](/books/ethics-of-ambiguity-book.md) , **he outsources his transcendence to women. By controlling, surpassing women, he believes he can transcend himself and nature**.
By being her educator, her benefactor, and even has her tyrant, he transcends himself through her, like parents who wishes to fulfill their own dreams using their children.

That is why on the one hand, when the men "owns" his woman, he wishes her to appear at her "best self", to highlight her "natural" features, mainly her body. **The more "natural" she appears, the stronger his rule over nature**. Similarly, that is why she is in charge of all the "natural" aspects of day to day living in the household, such as taking care of food, raising the children, basic chores. All these are a continuation of her as a representor of nature, while men is "out there" pursuing dreams and aspirations, fulfilling a higher calling, in his road to transcendence, while she remains in the low, natural state of living.
But on the other hand, **when she is not yet "yours" to conquer, she is a threat**. Her sexuality has to be hidden, she is a devil, a force of temptation and corruption, i.e the negative aspects of nature and "earthly desires". Therefore she should be controlled, tamed, reduced to a mere servant, to be similar to man, a pure soul in servitude of his god, being guided by him.

- In the embellished woman, Nature was present but captive, shaped by a human will in accordance with man‚Äôs desire.

### Part 5 - Formative Years
#### Childhood

**One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman**. [Social Construct](/notes/social-construct.md)
Nothing in our biology suggests that female should be grown up to be women. Children from both sexes act similarly during their early years.

**It is when we, parents, family, society, start to treat those two differently, that we educate them to be "man" and "woman".** When we stop "pampering" the boys, telling them to be strong, to be independent.
When we let girls play only with dolls, showing them that their job is to take care, to put others first.

adults value and praise a boy‚Äôs sexuality in compensation for his earlier weaning; this teaches him to identify his sexuality with his independence and transcendence. On the other hand, girls‚Äô sexuality is neither praised nor acknowledged, which leaves them more confused and often leads them to wish they were boys.
While boys have an "inherent" device that symbolizes their transcendence (their penis), girls don't have that, so they are forced to seek transcendence through others, whether by playing with dolls (being a care taker) or seeking the attention of adults, both cases they are becoming an object.

As they enter puberty, women are given responsibilities in the house earlier on than boys. However, they learn that women are limited to these kinds of chores. Thus, **although they might mature faster, they are also stuck in this state for the rest of their lives, while boys get to explore and grow over time**. At the same time, they are taught to approach love by submitting to the will of men. sex and puberty are associated with shame and pain.

#### The Girl

**While women are for men only one factor in a complete life, for women, men and marriage are the only goal they can aspire to**. Just as boys start to develop more aggressive games in adolescence, girls are encouraged to become more passive. de Beauvoir claims that their awareness of their physical weakness leads them to lose confidence in everything else about themselves.

**They also begin to think of themselves as objects and become obsessed with their own appearance, because this is the only thing men care about when they approach women**. They grow up to be confused because they are divided between accepting their feminine destiny to be passive, and rebelling against it.

:::note[Quotes]

:::


#### Sexual Experiences

Girls sexual awakening is a violent act. While men transition smoothly and remain at the center of their sexuality, women must accept domination. **Women are always expected to be passive and submissive, while men are encouraged to be active**. Women also approach sex from a more difficult position because they are conflicted about giving in to their desires. **Their sexuality is less by physical touch, in the way a man‚Äôs is, and more by the situation as a whole**.

- the adolescent girl does not consider herself responsible for her future; she judges it useless to demand much of herself since her lot in the end will not depend on her. Far from destining herself to man because she thinks she is inferior to him, it is because she is destined for him that, in accepting the idea of her inferiority, she constitutes it.

#### The Married Woman

**marriage remains unequal for women because it represents the only way for a girl to enter into society and be economically secure, while boys do not face the same pressure because they can work and live independently**. Wives are expected to serve their husbands and take care of the house and children, instead of having their own interests or lives outside of the home. The wife can only interact with society through her husband, and has no sense of independence or future

women are often very conflicted about marriage because it is both beneficial and harmful to them. They often marry because they think they should, and end up in situations they did not expect. Because no one talks to them about what to expect, either from married life or from losing their virginity, many women feel violated by their first sexual experience with their husbands, and continue to feel miserable in their sexual relations. **Most men are not in love with their wives, but rather think of them as property**. Love and marriage generally do not go together for either gender because marriage is an oppressive and unequal institution.

**To compensate for their lack of freedom outside the house, women often become domineering within the space of the home** and fixate completely on housework. However, this work is largely meaningless because it does not create anything new or contribute to society, leaving women unhappy and unfulfilled overall.

:::note[Quotes]

- Marriage has always been presented in radically different ways for men and for women. The two sexes are necessary for each other, but this necessity has never fostered reciprocity; ([Location¬†8715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=8715))
- The male‚Äôs vocation is action; he needs to produce, fight, create, progress, go beyond himself toward the totality of the universe and the infinity of the future; but traditional marriage does not invite woman to transcend herself with him; it confines her in immanence. She has no choice but to build a stable life where the present, prolonging the past, escapes the threats of tomorrow, ([Location¬†9260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=9260))
- The housewife wears herself out running on the spot; she does nothing; she only perpetuates the present; she never gains the sense that she is conquering a positive Good, but struggles indefinitely against Evil. It is a struggle that begins again every day. ([Location¬†9371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=9371))
- the product of housework has to be consumed; constant renunciation is demanded of the wife whose work is finished only with its destruction. For her to consent to it without regret, these small holocausts must spark some joy or pleasure somewhere. But as housework is spent in maintaining the status quo, the husband‚Äîwhen he comes home‚Äînotices disorder and negligence but takes order and neatness for granted. ([Location¬†9541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=9541))
- The wife is not allowed to do any positive work and consequently to have herself known as a complete person. Regardless of how well she is respected, she is subjugated, secondary, parasitic. The heavy curse weighing on her is that the very meaning of her existence is not in her hands. This is the reason the successes and failures of her conjugal life have much more importance for her than for the man: he is a citizen, a producer, before being a husband; she is above all, and often exclusively, a wife; ([Location¬†9569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=9569))

- the woman wants to ‚Äúhold on to‚Äù her husband as well as to refuse his domination. She struggles against him to defend her autonomy, and she fights against the rest of the world to conserve the ‚Äúsituation‚Äù that dooms her to dependence. ([Location¬†9933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=9933))
- the union of two human beings is doomed to failure if it requires an effort for each of them to complete each other, which supposes a primal mutilation; marriage must combine two autonomous existences, not be a withdrawal, an annexation, an escape, a remedy. ([Location¬†10235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=10235))
- The big difference is that for the wife, dependence is interiorized; she is a slave even when she conducts herself with apparent freedom, while the husband is essentially autonomous and enchained from the outside.

#### The Mother

for women, becoming a mother means fulfilling their natural duty, but it is not true transcendence since it is according to nature, and not from surpassing what is ‚Äúnatural.‚Äù

**women feel ambivalent about childbirth because it represents new life, but also the eventuality of their own death**. Pregnancy can be fulfilling for certain women in all the wrong ways: they might feel like they finally have a purpose in life, but this is a dangerous mindset because, of course, pregnancy cannot last forever and thus cannot always provide women with a purpose. Often, women can be disappointed when the child is finally born and is not everything they expected it to be.

Some women can think of children as their double, or their reason for existing. This can become complicated as children get older because they develop their individuality and often disappoint their mothers. Motherhood can be positive if women approach it in a healthy way and do not expect their love to be reciprocated in the same way they offer it.

Mothers are likely to try to control and limit their sons, while thinking of their daughters as their doubles and relating to them more closely. However, when either a son or daughter attempts to be independent of their mother, women can react negatively and try to stop this process. Thus, **the oppression of women is negative both for women and for their children**.

:::note[Quotes]

- Forced motherhood results in bringing miserable children into the world, children whose parents cannot feed them, who become victims of public assistance or ‚Äúmartyr children.‚Äù ([Location¬†10416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=10416))

- there is no such thing as maternal ‚Äúinstinct‚Äù: the word does not in any case apply to the human species. The mother‚Äôs attitude is defined by her total situation and by the way she accepts it.

- it is a sophism to justify it by pretending that a law was written in heaven or in the bowels of the earth that requires that the mother and child belong to each other exclusively; this mutual belonging in reality only constitutes a double and harmful oppression. ([Location¬†11259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=11259))

:::

#### Social Life

marriage also limits women‚Äôs abilities to function in society. She claims that women can only try to show off and represent themselves to others in society, instead of having genuine connections with others. They express themselves through their wardrobes, which are often restrictive of movement and are designed only to make women appear attractive and limited. **Women‚Äôs clothes are so important because women are essentially thought of as decorative objects**. [form vs essence](/notes/form-vs-essence.md).

women often feel a rivalry with other women, since they are all competing for men‚Äôs attention, and this destroys women‚Äôs ability to remain true friends with one another. Adultery and women‚Äôs relationships with lovers are also shaped by their lack of freedom within their marriages; women often have lovers in order to take revenge on their husbands.

#### Prostitutes and Hetaeras

prostitution is also a response to the problems that exist in marriage; by sleeping with prostitutes, men are looking for more fulfilling sexual encounters outside of their boring marriages. Many prostitutes, who are forced to turn to this profession because they have no other options. Life for a hetaera is all a performance, and is therefore still unfulfilling and unequal to a man‚Äôs situation.

#### From Maturity to Old Age

**most women fear aging because they depend on their appearance to get by in society**. Old women are often faced with regrets, as well; they reflect back on a youth in which they were not able to accomplish anything beyond marriage and are generally frustrated with their situation. However, in some ways old age allows women greater freedom. They do not associate themselves as much with their physical bodies, and live more in their imaginations. Nevertheless, **their situation remains tragic because they only gain these freedoms once they are too old to make use of them**.

at this age, women place all of their hopes on their children and expect to live vicariously through them. This can be a negative situation for both the older mother and her child, as it is frustrating for both of them when the child wants to be more independent.

:::note[Quotes]

- the old woman‚Äôs wisdom still remains completely negative: it is contestation, accusation, refusal; it is sterile.

#### Woman‚Äôs Situation and Character

**woman‚Äôs situation has remained largely the same throughout history, leaving her oppressed and unequal when compared to men**. This means that her character has also remained mostly the same throughout history, since a woman‚Äôs character is shaped by her social situation. Woman‚Äôs character is described as: argumentative, petty, weak, immoral, selfish, and deceptive. However, women are like this because they must accept masculine authority, and this leads to many contradictions in their personalities and outlooks on life. Most of their faults are related to the fact that their opportunities are very limited. For this reason, **much of feminine behavior should be interpreted as a protest against the masculine order**.

- because of the fact that in woman this freedom remains abstract and empty, it cannot authentically assume itself except in revolt: this is the only way open to those who have no chance to build anything; they must refuse the limits of their situation and seek to open paths to the future; resignation is only a surrender and an evasion; for woman there is no other way out than to work for her liberation. This liberation can only be collective, and it demands above all that the economic evolution of the feminine condition be accomplished.

### Part 7 - Justifications
#### The Narcissist

**narcissism is an attitude that emerges from women‚Äôs oppressive social situation**. Narcissism is a process of alienation, in which women view themselves as an object and place supreme value on their physical being. **Since women cannot exist as subjects themselves, so they seek transcendence by losing themselves in something else. For some women, this ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù is the object that they represent in society**.

**They want to be recognized as important by those around them because they have no important skills or products to offer the world, besides the bare fact of their existence**. These kinds of women never build genuine connections with others because they insist on being the center of everyone‚Äôs existence and do not truly know themselves or the reality around them. Although narcissists may appear strong and self-absorbed, they are actually weak because their entire self-worth depends on how important they are to others.

- All love demands the duality of a subject and an object. ([Location¬†13151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=13151))

- It would be a grave error to believe that in choosing herself as the supreme end, she escapes dependence: on the contrary, she dooms herself to the most severe slavery; she does not make the most of her freedom, she makes herself an endangered object in the world and in foreign consciousnesses.

#### Woman in Love

omen in love can also lose themselves fully in their love affairs without being truly understood. **Love is all-consuming for women; they devote themselves entirely to pleasing the man they love. However, for men, love is just another piece of their lives**, as opposed to their entire existence. Women will inevitably be disappointed by their lovers because they expect too much of them. **By putting the beloved man on a pedestal, a woman sets herself up to be devastated when that man acts human and appears flawed**. At the same time, there is another contradiction inherent in women‚Äôs love for men: they want men to be godlike but they also want to possess them entirely. Similarly, women want to give themselves up entirely to men but also want men to fully appreciate this sacrifice and give them access to the world through their love. de Beauvoir believes that many women find self-worth only through the fact that a man loves them.

When a love affair is broken off, a woman often finds herself completely ruined. She not only loses economic benefits, but also feels like she has lost her entire purpose for living. On the other hand, men can usually recover more easily from the end of an affair because their affairs do not give them purpose in life.

- love is merely an occupation in the life of the man, while it is life itself for the woman. ([Location¬†13444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=13444))
- she only wants to be this loved woman, and nothing else has value in her eyes. For her to exist, then, her lover must be by her side, taken care of by her; she awaits his return, his desire, his waking; and as soon as he leaves her, she starts again to wait for him. ([Location¬†13809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=13809))
- One of the misfortunes of the woman in love is that her love itself disfigures her, demolishes her; she is no more than this slave, this servant, this too-docile mirror, this too-faithful echo. When she realizes it, her distress reduces her worth even more; ([Location¬†13861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=13861))

#### The Mystic

Religion and mysticism can be similar to the process of being in love or being consumed by narcissism. Women turn to worshipping God if they do not have a man to worship. **Women want to feel special and needed, as though some kind of important gaze is fixated on them**; this can be achieved either through narcissism, romance, or mysticism

:::note[Quotes]

- either the woman establishes a relation with an unreal: her double or God; or she creates an unreal relation with a real being; in any case, she has no grasp on the world; she does not escape her subjectivity; her freedom remains mystified; there is only one way of accomplishing it authentically: it is to project it by a positive action into human society.

### Part 8 - Towards Liberation

#### Chapter 14 - Independent Woman

women have more rights and are allowed to work and claim independence; however, these civic liberties are only abstract if economic autonomy is not also in place. **Women still face a greater burden when they try to work outside of the home, because they remain economically disadvantaged, dependent on husbands, or limited by the extra work required of them at home.** Women can only achieve total freedom while working if she is in a socialist society. Overall, women have only come ‚Äúhalfway‚Äù in terms of achieving true equality and independence because they still face extra challenges. For example, their femininity often contradicts their work. The more productive a woman is in society, the less ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù she is considered to be, and vice versa. For example, a woman who is considered dominant or intelligent can seem threatening or undesirable as a romantic prospect for men. For women who want to remain feminine while still pursuing their independent work, this presents a difficult dilemma.

Sex presents a contradiction for women who want to be independent, because the dynamics involved often subordinate women to men. For example, men are typically more dominant and initiate the encounter. This can seem like a threat to an independent woman‚Äôs sense of autonomy, however. Therefore, relations with men can complicate a woman‚Äôs ability to be productive and feel positive about her position in society.
Overall, an independent woman in de Beauvoir‚Äôs day was torn between her profession and her sexual life.

:::note[Quotes]

- It is through work that woman has been able, to a large extent, to close the gap separating her from the male; work alone can guarantee her concrete freedom. ([Location¬†14119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14119))
- For the married woman, her salary usually only means extra income; for the ‚Äúwoman who is helped,‚Äù it is the man‚Äôs protection that seems inessential; but neither woman buys total independence through her own efforts. ([Location¬†14148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14148))
- Man is a sexed human being; woman is a complete individual, and equal to the male, only if she too is a sexed human being. Renouncing her femininity means renouncing part of her humanity. ([Location¬†14164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14164))
- the individual is not free to shape the idea of femininity at will. By not conforming, a woman devalues herself sexually and consequently socially because society has incorporated sexual values. ([Location¬†14169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14169))
- If the woman proposes herself too boldly, the man flees: he insists on conquering. The woman can thus take only when she is prey: she must become a passive thing, a promise of submission. ([Location¬†14281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14281))
- when serious competitive exams are in question, the female student will become aware of her weaknesses; she will attribute them to the unjust curse of femaleness and not to the mediocrity of her education; resigning herself to this inequality, she exacerbates it; ([Location¬†14449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14449))
- for one to become a creator, it is not enough to be cultivated, that is, to make going to shows and meeting people part of one‚Äôs life; culture must be apprehended through the free movement of a transcendence; the spirit with all its riches must project itself in an empty sky that is its to fill; ([Location¬†14656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14656))
- What is beyond doubt is that until now women‚Äôs possibilities have been stifled and lost to humanity, and in her and everyone‚Äôs interest it is high time she be left to take her own chances. ([Location¬†14706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14706))

#### Conclusion

**The oppression of women is not only negative for all women, but also creates a conflict that involves and negatively impacts men**, as well. Ending such conflict will bring stability and peace to all of society.

I women can exist for themselves, they can continue to exist for men as well and both men and women can find greater satisfaction in love. Romantic relations are the basis for interactions between the two genders, in all spheres of life. The most exalted of human emotions, love, might become even more important and fulfilling if women were better treated throughout society.

:::note[Quotes]

- neither men nor women are satisfied with each other today. But the question is whether it is an original curse that condemns them to tear each other apart or whether the conflicts that pit them against each other express a transitory moment in human history. ([Location¬†14728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14728))
- humanity is something other than a species: it is a historical becoming; it is defined by the way it assumes natural facticity. ([Location¬†14732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14732))
- sexuality, moreover, has never seemed to us to define a destiny or to provide in itself the key to human behavior, but to express the totality of a situation it helps define. ([Location¬†14740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14740))
- The conflict will last as long as men and women do not recognize each other as peers, that is, as long as femininity is perpetuated as such; ([Location¬†14774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14774))
- this is how the woman is raised, without ever being taught the necessity of assuming her own existence; she readily lets herself count on the protection, love, help, and guidance of others; she lets herself be fascinated by the hope of being able to realize her being without doing anything. She is wrong to yield to this temptation; ([Location¬†14816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14816))
- One must certainly not think that modifying her economic situation is enough to transform woman: this factor has been and remains the primordial factor of her development, but until it brings about the moral, social, and cultural consequences it heralds and requires, the new woman cannot appear; ([Location¬†14882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14882))
- Woman is the victim of no mysterious fate; the singularities that make her different derive their importance from the meaning applied to them; they can be overcome as soon as they are grasped from new perspectives; ([Location¬†14914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007357B0W&location=14914))
- women need only pursue their rise, and the success they obtain encourages them; it seems most certain that they will sooner or later attain perfect economic and social equality, which will bring about an inner metamorphosis.

- it is up to man to make the reign of freedom triumph; to carry off this supreme victory, men and women must, among other things and beyond their natural differentiations, unequivocally affirm their brotherhood.
