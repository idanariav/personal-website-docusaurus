## ‚úíÔ∏è Note-Making

### üí°Clarify
üîà *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Babies are imitation machines** - babies learn through social interaction and social cues. Using a built-in method of imitation and learning, they are both motivated and capable of learning from the people near them.
2. **Learning is a boom and bust cycle** - at the first few years, it's all about exploration. They test everything, making new connections and run countless simulations. At later years, it's all about exploitation, old and useless connections are removed and useful connections are strengthened. No wonders babies do everything, while teenagers start to focus on "who they are"

### üóíÔ∏èRelate

‚õì *Life lessons, action items*
1. Spend more time with your child, be present, be communicative, and be a good role model

### üîçCritique

‚úÖ *by following this method, what will happen?*
1. You will understand how babies develop over time, how do they see the world, what are the limits of their knowledge and capabilities with each age/developmental milestone

‚ùå *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*

üß± *Implementations and limitations of it are...*
1. This is not a practical book, you have a better understanding of babies but it's more theoretical than practical. It satisfies your curiosity, not help you be a better parent necessarily

### üó®Ô∏èReview

üí≠ *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
I love the amount of philosophy mentioned in this book, each theory is referenced to ancient philosophers and known philosophical experiments. This is how science should be, the combination of modern scientific method with a strong foundation on philosophy.

However, most of the book is stuff that's interesting to read at the moment like scientific experiments and discoveries, but very forgettable with time, so there are few take aways from this book.

### Ancient Questions and a Young Science

How do we know what we know? As people, senses were our only method of studying for a long time, and as we know senses can be misleading [subjective reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md). Yet somehow babies are able to translate random sounds and sights into meaningful language and people in their lives.

This debate has a long history, from [Socrates](/notes/socrates-philosopher.md) argument in Meno that people are born with innate knowledge and all that we do is just to uncover it. In contrast with [John Locke](/notes/john-locke-philosopher.md) that said that people are born "tabula rasa", a [clean slate](/notes/clean-slate.md) to which we can imprint whatever we desire. In this debate of [nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md), while both have an influence on our behavior, it seems nurture has won. [empiricism](/notes/empiricism.md)

We are born with the genetic ability to learn from others [imitation](/notes/imitation.md), and this learning capabilities is what allows us to surpass hard-coded systems in our brain and adapt to our current environment's specific needs and conditions. We can't program endless situations in our brain, but we can learn quickly to adapt ourselves to each situation [adaptability](/notes/adaptability.md).

As a general rule, we can view the infancy period as a prolong time for running [simulations](/notes/simulations.md), there's a lot to learn and a safe environment to do so.

### What Children Learn about People

So far we had problems researching babies due to lack of technology and theory. The main issue with babies since we can't communicate with them is that we don't know what happens in their minds [We can't read minds](/notes/theory-of-mind.md).

However, through research we have discovered that their ability to connect with other people, especially people who they are familiar with like parents, is as innate as it gets [Human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md). Even day old newborns have the ability to [mirror](/notes/mirroring.md) your behavior. They will try to stick out their tongue or open their mouth if you do the same. They will prefer people over animals/objects, and prefer familiar people by sight or smell. They attempt to solve the "other minds" problem by linking themselves to others, they assume that "we are the same", and develop through imitating others [interpersonal identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md).

This means that solving the other mind problem is also key to [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md), through understanding others we understand ourselves.

One year old's will start to take social cues from others, for example following where grown ups are pointing, imitating how they interact with objects, adjust their reactions to events based on how grown ups react.

When they reach 1.5 year old, they start to understand that they and others don't share the same preferences. For example, if they have a choice between two snacks, they would offer the snack the other prefers, even if it is not their own favorite.

This realization is deepened around 2 year olds, that can start to feel [empathy](/notes/empathy.md) to others. They not only recognize someone else have a different mental state than they do, they will also share their pain and try to alleviate it.

At around age 3, this develops into accepting differences in knowledge and perspective. What you see might not be what I see, what you know might not be what I know and vice versa.

At age 4 it develops from the physical concrete knowledge to abstract beliefs. We might not share the same beliefs. Also, our beliefs could be false and change over time. This is also when they start to lie effectively.

- Nature ingeniously gives us a jump start on the Other Minds problem. We know, quite directly, that we are like other people and they are like us. ([Location¬†594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00134XEU0&location=594))
- One-year-old babies know that they will see something by looking where other people point; they know what they should do to something by watching what other people do; they know how they should feel about something by seeing how other people feel.

- These tiny children, barely able to talk, have already learned an extremely important thing about people.

- Systematic studies indicate that two-year-olds begin to show genuine empathy toward other people for the first time. Even younger babies will become upset in response to the distress of others ([Location¬†710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00134XEU0&location=710))
- Real empathy isn‚Äôt just about knowing that other people feel the same way you do; it‚Äôs about knowing that they don‚Äôt feel the same way and caring anyway. ([Location¬†717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00134XEU0&location=717))

### What Children Learn about Things

It was found that babies from a very early age already have a sense of distance, texture, of shapes and movement. They are able to translate raw senses into understanding objects as a whole entity. That's why for example newborns are fixated by strips, because they form the first noticeable way to separate between one thing and the other.

More abstract concepts such as object permanence and causality takes more time to develop, usually around 1.5 year old.

From their first moment, every interaction with an object is a method of [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md). Through what looks like play, the understand the limits, the features and the purpose of each object.

### What Children Learn about Language

Language is a work of magic, of deep complex. yet babies are able to do what computers (so far) have failed to do. To translate sound into meaning and ideas. This is even more astonishing considering not only the vast amount of words out there, but also the fact that letters sound different depending on the word, each speaker sounds different, and lastly the co dependence of words on each other and on the culture [Semantics of words](/notes/semantics-of-words.md).

Some say this is an innate talent of humans. That we are hardwired to learn language because it is a useful social tool, part of the context of the environment.

At first (around 6 months), babies first categorize different sounds to what we categorize as letters. For example, how we pronounce "r", "l", "g" and so forth. This is where the parent's accent starts to affect the babies language development. At around 1 year this process ends, which symbolizes the end of the "universal" settings of the baby and into a "localized" version. They will start to combine sounds into words.

When we speak "parentese", i.e a slow, melodic, with high pronunciation of words (like "baby talk") we actually make language learning more enticing and easier to do.

:::note[What Children Learn About Language]

- It‚Äôs as if the speakers of each language have a very different way of transforming the actual sound waves that come into their ears into a set of language sounds. ([Location¬†1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00134XEU0&location=1613))
- Babies master the sounds of their language first, and that makes the words easier to learn. ([Location¬†1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00134XEU0&location=1685))
- Language is as much invented as learned. Babies don‚Äôt simply soak up associations between names and things or mimic adults‚Äô use of words. Instead, they actively restructure language to suit their own purposes. ([Location¬†1785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00134XEU0&location=1785))

### What Scientists Have Learned about Children's Minds

When we want to understand a computer, it's much more useful to see which program it has, what kind of outputs we get based on the inputs, rather than prying it open and see it's components. What makes human research even more difficult is that babies are much more like scientists than computers. Not only that they have multiple complex programs, they also adjust and rewrite those over time. They change what they know and believe based on what they experience [scientific method](/notes/scientific-method.md). Not only that, but they also enjoy the learning process.

### What Scientists Have Learned about Children's Brains

When it comes to brain development, it's all about [Neuroplasticity](/notes/neuroplasticity.md). The brain can and does change over time, new [Connections](/notes/coherentism.md) are made. At the early years it prefers quantity over quality, but around puberty it ruthlessly destroys old, weak connections it doesn't need, thus improving the strength of the existing connections [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md).

However, it does seem that it's also about [Timing](/notes/contextual-synergy.md). The brain develops more as the person is younger, meaning that some habits and skills are easier to learn.

:::note[What Scientists Have Learned About Children‚Äôs Brains]

- The brain itself, like knowledge, seems to be rather like Ulysses‚Äô boat, discussed in the previous chapter. It changes in a multitude of ways in response to the things that go on around it. Moreover, changes that take place early in the journey may dictate which changes will take place later on. ([Location¬†2883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00134XEU0&location=2883))

### Trailing Clouds of Glory

Babies brains are like [Theseus ship](/notes/theseus-ship.md), they develop it while sailing, replacing parts as they go along, and which parts they replace and to what is crucial for their development later on.

Babies learn through human interaction. On its simplest level, we should spend quality time with them, and know that being with them doesn't only give them joy, but also develops them better than any other way.

The second implication is how our society looks like, perhaps we should be more tolerable and compassionate about providing enough free time for parents to be with their children.

:::note[Trailing Clouds of Glory]

- Babies are already as smart as they can be, they know what they need to know, and they are very effective and selective in getting the kinds of information they need. They are designed to learn about the real world that surrounds them, and they learn by playing with the things in that world, most of all by playing with the people who love them. ([Location¬†2942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00134XEU0&location=2942))
- We human beings seem designed to complete our grandest projects by pursuing ordinary little joys. ([Location¬†3083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00134XEU0&location=3083))
