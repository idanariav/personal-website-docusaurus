## ✒️ Note-Making

### 💡Clarify
🔈 *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Experimentation** - it's better to "test and learn" than "plan and implement" approach to achieve specialization. Being too focused on grit can cause us to get locked on sub optimal options
2. **Overspecialization is a trap** - to overspecialize in one domain is good when we're dealing with "kind problems", where everything is clear and well defined. However we face mostly wicked problems that change and become complex over time. Only adaptability, learning and interdisciplinary will allow for creative solutions.
3. **Diversity is key** - interdisciplinary learning increases creativity, matching of skills with desires. Diversity, especially if opinions helps us avoid confirmation bias and enables us to see problems in a new light
4. **Learning should be hard** - using analogies as mental shortcuts, and encouraging struggle for exploration rather than giving easy answers or procedures.

### 🗒️Relate

⛓ *Life lessons, action items*
1. **Every knowledge could be useful someday**, you just don't know it

### 🔍Critique

✅ *by following this method, what will happen?*
1. **Better Matching** - One can find a better match for his skills which will increase his well-being, his productivity, and achievements.
2. **More Creativity** - One can be more creative, finding his unique contribution to the world, his own unique combination of knowledge.

❌ *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*
1. **you've got to be lucky** - The book focused on those who made it, that had the perfect combination of niche knowledge, right time and place, and the right challenge. I believe this is hardly representative of the "everyday situations" where one has experimented in various fields thought his life. Meaning that the creativity point is his weakest argument in the book (compared to the matching point).

🧱 *Implementations and limitations of it are...*
1. **no prior knowledge** - As he says at the end, being creative is a hit and miss, so you can never know in advance which knowledge fields would be beneficial for you to learn, because it is a rare act where intersectionality works in your favor, but when it does its amazing.
2. **if not planning, what else?** - While we get the message that planning is bad, we are left without something else to guide us instead other than "do you think you will enjoy it? great" or "were you forced to spend time on this? it might still be useful"

### 🗨️Review

💭 *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
The book is nice, but not a lot more than that. The two main ideas are presented in the beginning of the book, and later chapters are just examples of those ideas. Some chapters are just the examples without even a distillment of the author to the main takeaways of that chapter.

## 📒 Notes

### Intro

we tend to think about elite performers are early starters, as hyper specialized in their fields.
However, **its the turtle, not the rabbit, who gets the last laugh**.

:::note[INTRODUCTION]

- Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts. Instead, they undergo what researchers call a “sampling period.” ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=191))
- early career specializers jumped out to an earnings lead after college, but that later specializers made up for the head start by finding work that better fit their skills and personalities. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=221))
- highly credentialed experts can become so narrow-minded that they actually get worse with experience, even while becoming more confident—a dangerous combination. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=249))
- learning itself is best done slowly to accumulate lasting knowledge, even when that means performing poorly on tests of immediate progress. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=251))
- The challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization.

### Chapter 1 - the Curse of Overspecialization

in todays world, it seems like [Specialization](/notes/specialization.md) in early age is the key for achievement in life. However, most fields are not as easy to master as others [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md) Fields are divided into 2 types:
1. **Kind fields** - where the field is a closed system, usually scientific in origin, where each interaction provides useful information, feedback, and the goal is clear. Examples are usually abstract games such as chess, individual sports such as golf, or fields such as physics and mathematics. in these types of fields, it's easier to develop [Mental Representations](/notes/mental-representations.md) that help you become an expert. [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md). *Does that means that [Deliberate Practice](/notes/deliberate-practice.md) can only happen in kind fields?*
2. **Wicked fields** - these fields are open-ended, which means that the rules, the motivation and the type of interaction between agents constantly change [Problems](/notes/problems.md), the feedback is far off and obscure if any, and perhaps you have low control on the outcome. Usually social sciences fit into this criteria, areas such as economics, psychology, predictions, etc... [Ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md).

We now know that narrow specialization will be the realm of AI. Tactics is their specialty, while we have to think strategy.

:::note[The Cult of the Head Start]

- In those domains, which involved human behavior and where patterns did not clearly repeat, repetition did not cause learning. Chess, golf, and firefighting are exceptions, not the rule. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=371))
- The learning environment is kind because a learner improves simply by engaging in the activity and trying to do better. Kahneman was focused on the flip side of kind learning environments; Hogarth called them “wicked.” In wicked domains, the rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=382))
- The reason that elite athletes seem to have superhuman reflexes is that they recognize patterns of ball or body movements that tell them what’s coming before it happens. When tested outside of their sport context, their superhuman reactions disappear. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=454))
- The successful adapters were excellent at taking knowledge from one pursuit and applying it creatively to another, and at avoiding cognitive entrenchment. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=586))

### Chapter 2 - the History of Overspecialization

Creativity and critical thinking had made two large jumps:
1. From one-mode thinking -> abstract concepts
2. From abstract concepts -> interdisciplinary

Our jump from small tight agricultural communities to large modern cities has been the first jump of our mental capabilities. The main idea was that in those communities, you only had to specialize in one thing, your farm. All experience related to that, and it highly limited the kind of ideas, questions and concepts you can grasp.
Modernity has brought us the scientific lens, and with that the ability to separate experience and abstract ideas. We could theories things we have not encountered before.
Lastly, the jump the face today has to be from imagining abstract concepts, to combining knowledge and experience from different fields to form a new theory or concept. Everything else, especially the repetitive simple tasks will be automated.

:::note[How the Wicked World Was Made]

- Exposure to the modern world has made us better adapted for complexity, and that has manifested as flexibility, with profound implications for the breadth of our intellectual world. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=724))
- The more constrained and repetitive a challenge, the more likely it will be automated, while great rewards will accrue to those who can take conceptual knowledge from one problem or domain and apply it in an entirely new one. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=842))

### Chapter 3 - Breath for Mastery

When looking at musical prodigies in the past, it's those who have tried our different instruments that were the best performers.
By learning through experience [learning by doing](/notes/learning-by-doing.md) rather than closed ended thinking (the difference between improvising music to only reading from a music sheet) they could achieve much higher mastery.
That led to a better [Intuition](/notes/intuition.md) on how to become better and be more creative.

:::note[When Less of the Same Is More]

- breadth of training predicts breadth of transfer. That is, the more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models, and the less they rely on any particular example. Learners become better at applying their knowledge to a situation they’ve never seen before, which is the essence of creativity. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1188))

:::


### Chapter 4 - Learning is Supposed to Be Hard

There are two types of learning:
1. **Using-procedure**: when x happens, do y. This is a close ended way of thinking, similar to a computer program, we treat knowledge like a dictionary, and we're able to give a response only if we have the right translation for the task at hand.
2. **connection making** - this is the more abstract kind of learning. [learning should be hard](/notes/learning-should-be-hard.md). By combining knowledge from different areas, or [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md), we can theorize, test and derive the solution ourselves even on unfamiliar situations.

The key here is that there is a tradeoff between these two. **Procedural thinking is faster in the short run, but preforms worse in the long run**. This is similar to [exploration vs exploitation](/notes/exploration-vs-exploitation.md), when a short term investment is worth it in the long run

Teachers, parents sometimes try to be helpful but in the end lead to worse outcomes, we tend to give the kid the answer, or the way to solve the question, therefore denying him from the struggle of exploration. It is this struggle which exactly produces long term learning.
If learning is easy, then you know it's not working. [Dont Jump to the Rescue](/notes/dont-jump-to-the-rescue.md)
Instead, we should help the child to think on its own, giving him tools for explore rather than procedures to follow.

:::note[Learning, Fast and Slow]

- for learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), fast and easy is precisely the problem. ([Location 1296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1296))
- Training without hints is slow and error-ridden. It is, essentially, what we normally think of as testing, except for the purpose of learning rather than evaluation—when ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1335))
- Struggling to retrieve information primes the brain for subsequent learning, even when the retrieval itself is unsuccessful. ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1341))

:::


### Chapter 5 - Analogs as Mental Shortcuts

Using analogies could be very helpful for learning. They allow us to quickly move mental representations from one field of knowledge to the other. [Transferred Learning](/notes/transferred-learning.md)
Like saying that newton mechanics are like billiard balls, or that gravity is like magnets. By using analogies, we save mental effort and increase creativity at the same time [Analogies](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md)

:::note[Thinking Outside Experience]

- Deep analogical thinking is the practice of recognizing conceptual similarities in multiple domains or scenarios that may seem to have little in common on the surface. It is a powerful tool for solving wicked problems, ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1555))

:::


### Chapter 6 - Grit Vs Matching

we tend to believe that [Grit](/notes/grit.md) is the answer for success, that by sticking out no matter what we will achieve the best result. However, **it is worth knowing to pick our battles, to choose which field should we have grit for**.
Therefore, **[Matching](/notes/matching.md) should come before grit**. When we test our different fields, we have more benefits in the long run than early specializers. We have more chances of finding the field that is right for us in terms of welfare and skills.

:::note[The Trouble with Too Much Grit]

- Learning stuff was less important than learning about oneself. Exploration is not just a whimsical luxury of education; it is a central benefit. ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1964))

:::


### Chapter 7 - Flirting with Your Possible Selves
**Our mode of thinking should be "test and learn" rather than "plan and implement"** [Empiricism](/notes/empiricism.md). We learn who we are by acting, not by [introspection](/notes/introspection.md).

:::note[Flirting with Your Possible Selves]

- The precise person you are now is fleeting, just like all the other people you’ve been. ([Location 2346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2346))
- The only certainty is change, both on average as a generation ages, and within each individual. ([Location 2348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2348))
- Because personality changes more than we expect with time, experience, and different contexts, we are ill-equipped to make ironclad long-term goals when our past consists of little time, few experiences, and a narrow range of contexts. ([Location 2394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2394))
- we learn who we are only by living, and not before. ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2407))
- Rather than a grand plan, find experiments that can be undertaken quickly. “Test-and-learn,” Ibarra told me, “not plan-and-implement.” ([Location 2440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2440))
- you don’t know what’s good and what’s bad when things happen. You do not know. You have to wait to find out.” ([Location 2473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2473))

:::


### Chapter 8 - Interdisciplinary

By combining knowledge from different fields, it is more likely to come up with creative solutions.

:::note[The Outsider Advantage]

- “Big innovation most often happens when an outsider who may be far away from the surface of the problem reframes the problem in a way that unlocks the solution.” ([Location 2654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2654))

:::


### Chapter 9 - Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology

:::note[Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology]

- Facing uncertain environments and wicked problems, breadth of experience is invaluable. Facing kind problems, narrow specialization can be remarkably efficient. The problem is that we often expect the hyperspecialist, because of their expertise in a narrow area, to magically be able to extend their skill to wicked problems. The results can be disastrous. ([Location 3184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3184))

:::


### Chapter 10 - Fooled by Expertise

Why sometimes experts get it wrong? It happens when they are fixated by their opinions.
**A true expert should think of his ideas as theories to be tested**. [Falsification](/notes/scientific-method.md) He should be encouraged to find cases where he is wrong, and avoid [Conformation Bias](/notes/conformation-bias.md).

:::note[Fooled by Expertise]

- The best forecasters view their own ideas as hypotheses in need of testing. Their aim is not to convince their teammates of their own expertise, but to encourage their teammates to help them falsify their own notions. ([Location 3372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3372))

:::


### Chapter 11 - Learning by Forgetting

**In situations we haven't encountered before, that don't fit any of our known powers, it is sometimes useful to rethink our default "tools" that we use to analyze the situation.**
For example, firefighters who are caught in a rapidly expanding fire should drop their tools to be able to run faster, but since their tools are part of their identity as firefighters, most don't do it even when commanded to [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md).
By creating [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md) between the situation and our "go -o" methods of thinking, we can perhaps find new and creative ways to solve it. [Rethinking](/notes/rethinking.md)

Therefore, **it is important to develop [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md) of opinions in your team, and encourage flow of information through various connections, and not just top-down hierarchy.**

:::note[Learning to Drop Your Familiar Tools]

- experienced groups became rigid under pressure and “regress to what they know best.” They behaved like a collective hedgehog, bending an unfamiliar situation to a familiar comfort zone, as if trying to will it to become something they actually had experienced before. ([Location 3638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3638))
- There are no tools that cannot be dropped, reimagined, or repurposed in order to navigate an unfamiliar challenge. Even the most sacred tools. Even the tools so taken for granted they become invisible. It is, of course, easier said than done. Especially when the tool is the very core of an organization’s culture. ([Location 3685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3685))

:::


### Chapter 12 - Deliberate Amateurs

:::note[Deliberate Amateurs]

- work that builds bridges between disparate pieces of knowledge is less likely to be funded, less likely to appear in famous journals, more likely to be ignored upon publication, and then more likely in the long run to be a smash hit in the library of human knowledge. ([Location 4158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=4158))

:::


### Chapter 13 - Expanding Your Range

:::note[Expanding Your Range]

- Compare yourself to yourself yesterday, not to younger people who aren’t you. Everyone progresses at a different rate, so don’t let anyone else make you feel behind. You probably don’t even know where exactly you’re going, so feeling behind doesn’t help. ([Location 4275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=4275))
- Approach your own personal voyage and projects like Michelangelo approached a block of marble, willing to learn and adjust as you go, and even to abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely should the need arise. ([Location 4279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=4279))
