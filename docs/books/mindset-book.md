üîà *Summary of main ideas*
nothing about you is permanent, you can improve your skills, your intelligence, and act better. you just have to treat obstacles as opportunities to learn, search for feedback and mentors, and believe in others.

growth mindset is truly a key to self improvement, enjoyment and success in all areas of life. it is a way to have less stress, anger when facing obstacles.

the book is a clear repetition of a simple and narrow idea, in less than 20% of the book, she explains the growth mindset idea, and then for the next 80% is a combination of students praising her and examples which shows the same thing - growth mindset good, fixed mindset bad

## üìí Notes

### The Mindset
There are two options:
1. **Fixed mindset** - the belief that what you have at birth is fixed, for example intelligence is fixed. In those cases you will want to prove yourself, since if everyone won't change, then you want to [signal](/notes/signaling.md) that you're part of the good ones. (Related:: [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md) )
2. **growth mindset** - instead of proving, they are growing. *Intelligence and other skills could be cultivated*. [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md)

We have to remember that genes and biology are not fixed but rather are dependent and respond to the environment ([nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md))

:::note[THE MINDSETS]

- not only do genes and environment cooperate as we develop, but genes require input from the environment to work properly.
- the view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life.
- growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts, your strategies, and help from others.
- Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better?
- The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it‚Äôs not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset.
- If, like those with the growth mindset, you believe you can develop yourself, then you‚Äôre open to accurate information about your current abilities, even if it‚Äôs unflattering. What‚Äôs more, if you‚Äôre oriented toward learning, as they are, you need accurate information about your current abilities in order to learn effectively.
- The fixed mindset makes you concerned with how you‚Äôll be judged; the growth mindset makes you concerned with improving.

### Into the Mindset
those with a growth mindset not only seek the [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md), they thrive in it. they search for [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md) and see everything as a chance to learn and improve. [Obstacles as stepping stones](/notes/creative-destruction.md)
For a fixed mindset, failure is connected to your identity, it defines you, and since your skills are immutable, you have nothing to do with the failure, only to try and boost your self esteem by looking for easier challenges, or blaming the world. [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md).

While for growth mindset, there is a disconnect between action and identity, [What we do is not who we are](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md) you are not defined by your failures, since you know they are a stepping stone on your way to become better. [Failure](/notes/failure.md)

**It's not that growth mindset people don't feel bad when they fail, the difference is that they use those feelings as motivation** to learn and improve by using [Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md)

Fixed mindset people tend to view success as binary [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md), either I succeeded or not. But growth mindset people tend to **view their actions and goals as a scale, on their way to be their best self**.

Labeling and praise:
[how to give praises](/notes/how-to-give-praises.md)
*You should praise effort, not abilities* - for example "you worked really hard, or it's good when you so x" and not "you are so smart".
When a fixed mindset gets positive praise, they are afraid to lose it so they will avoid challenges, and when they get negative labeling they will be afraid that it's correct. Having a growth mindset and praising effort will use these praises as motivation, and learn to avoid negative labeling since it doesn't connect to their identity.

:::note[INSIDE THE MINDSETS]

- People in a growth mindset don‚Äôt just seek challenge, they thrive on it. The bigger the challenge, the more they stretch.
- ‚ÄúBecoming is better than being.‚Äù The fixed mindset does not allow people the luxury of becoming. They have to already be.
- People with the growth mindset know that it takes time for potential to flower.
- people who believe in fixed traits feel an urgency to succeed, and when they do, they may feel more than pride. They may feel a sense of superiority, since success means that their fixed traits are better than other people‚Äôs. However, lurking behind that self-esteem of the fixed mindset is a simple question: If you‚Äôre somebody when you‚Äôre successful, what are you when you‚Äôre unsuccessful?
- Even in the growth mindset, failure can be a painful experience. But it doesn‚Äôt define you. It‚Äôs a problem to be faced, dealt with, and learned from.
- instead of trying to learn from and repair their failures, people with the fixed mindset may simply try to repair their self-esteem.
- The more depressed people with the growth mindset felt (short of severe depression), the more they took action to confront their problems,
- no matter what your ability is, effort is what ignites that ability and turns it into accomplishment.
- Success is about being your best self, not about being better than others;
- growth mindset does allow people to love what they‚Äôre doing‚Äîand to continue to love it in the face of difficulties.
- You don‚Äôt have to think you‚Äôre already great at something to want to do it and to enjoy doing it.

### The Truth about Ability and Accomplishment (I skipped)

:::note[THE TRUTH ABOUT ABILITY AND ACCOMPLISHMENT]

- With the right mindset and the right teaching, people are capable of a lot more than we think.
- in the fixed mindset, both positive and negative labels can mess with your mind. When you‚Äôre given a positive label, you‚Äôre afraid of losing it, and when you‚Äôre hit with a negative label, you‚Äôre afraid of deserving it.
- growth mindset helps people to see prejudice for what it is‚Äîsomeone else‚Äôs view of them‚Äîand to confront it with their confidence and abilities intact.

### Business: Mindset and Leadership

CEOs with fixed mindsets are focused on their [Ego](/notes/form-vs-essence.md) and image, they surround themselves with yes men, avoid criticism and are often mean to those beneath them. **While growth mindset leaders see their work as part of a team**, they search for feedback and criticism, and try to develop the potential of their employees. [People First](/notes/people-first.md) [Transparency](/notes/transparency.md) [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md)

:::note[BUSINESS: MINDSET AND LEADERSHIP]

- when people live in an environment that esteems them for their innate talent, they have grave difficulty when their image is threatened:
- they are constantly trying to improve. They surround themselves with the most able people they can find, they look squarely at their own mistakes and deficiencies, and they ask frankly what skills they and the company will need in the future.
- the power that CEOs wield allows them to create a world that caters night and day to their need for validation. It allows them to surround themselves only with the good news of their perfection and the company‚Äôs success, no matter what the warning signs may be. This, as you may recall, is CEO disease and a peril of the fixed mindset.
- True self-confidence is ‚Äúthe courage to be open‚Äîto welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source.‚Äù
- leadership is about growth and passion, not about brilliance.
- Groupthink can happen when the group gets carried away with its brilliance and superiority.

### Relationships: Mindets in Love (or not)

fixed mindset people believe that relationships should come easy, in a binary way - either it works or it doesn't. happily ever after since day one. However this is a belief that is a source of heartbreaks. Strong, **happy relationships demand constant work and upkeep, it relies on a stable communication, on understanding that people can change**, and probably will change throughout their lives, so no challenge is necessarily permanent. [Relationships](/notes/relationships.md)

:::note[RELATIONSHIPS: MINDSETS IN LOVE (OR NOT)]

- A no-effort relationship is a doomed relationship, not a great relationship. It takes work to communicate accurately and it takes work to expose and resolve conflicting hopes and beliefs.
- Your failures and misfortunes don‚Äôt threaten other people‚Äôs self-esteem. Ego-wise, it‚Äôs easy to be sympathetic to someone in need. It‚Äôs your assets and your successes that are problems for people who derive their self-esteem from being superior.
- The shy growth-mindset people take control of their shyness. They go out and meet new people, and, after their nerves settle down, their relationships proceed normally. The shyness doesn‚Äôt tyrannize them. But for fixed-mindset people, the shyness takes control. It keeps them out of social situations with new people, and when they‚Äôre in them, they can‚Äôt let down their guard and let go of their fears.

### Parents, Teachers and Coaches

kids are very observant, they can detect the subtext very easily. So when we praise them, it is important to do so in a way that promotes a growth mindset - i.e praise effort, actions, and learning - instead of intellect or talent.
and when something bad happens - be a teacher, not a judge. Focus on how can we learn and improve, and not punishment or judgment.

:::note[PARENTS, TEACHERS, AND COACHES: WHERE DO MINDSETS COME FROM?]

- children love praise. And they especially love to be praised for their intelligence and talent. It really does give them a boost, a special glow‚Äîbut only for the moment. The minute they hit a snag, their confidence goes out the window and their motivation hits rock bottom. If success means they‚Äôre smart, then failure means they‚Äôre dumb.
- If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, seek new strategies, and keep on learning.
- children need honest and constructive feedback. If children are ‚Äúprotected‚Äù from it, they won‚Äôt learn well.
- Don‚Äôt judge. Teach. It‚Äôs a learning process.
- Great teachers set high standards for all their students, not just the ones who are already achieving.
- When teachers are judging them, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. But when students understand that school is for them‚Äîa way for them to grow their minds‚Äîthey do not insist on sabotaging themselves.
- Beware of success. It can knock you into a fixed mindset:
- If a student has tried hard and made little or no progress, we can of course appreciate their effort, but we should never be content with effort that is not yielding further benefits. We need to figure out why that effort is not effective and guide kids toward other strategies and resources that can help them resume learning.
- You don‚Äôt get a growth mindset by proclamation. You move toward it by taking a journey.

:::


### Changing Mindsets

To see yourself as a work in progress doesn't mean you are less yourself, or that you are not whole, but rather the opposite. In the process of self actualizing, you become yourself [transcendence](/notes/transcendence.md).

Embracing new beliefs doesn't mean that the old ones are discarded, but rather they exist side by side with the old ones [Apperception](/notes/layering.md)

:::note[CHANGING MINDSETS]

- when you change, the old beliefs aren‚Äôt just removed like a worn-out hip or knee and replaced with better ones. Instead, the new beliefs take their place alongside the old ones,
- opening yourself up to growth makes you more yourself, not less.
- Think of something you need to do, something you want to learn, or a problem you have to confront. What is it? Now make a concrete plan. When will you follow through on your plan? Where will you do it? How will you do it? Think about it in vivid detail.
- When people drop the good‚Äìbad, strong‚Äìweak thinking that grows out of the fixed mindset, they‚Äôre better able to learn useful strategies that help with self-control. Every lapse doesn‚Äôt spell doom. It‚Äôs like anything else in the growth mindset. It‚Äôs a reminder that you‚Äôre an unfinished human being and a clue to how to do it better next time.
