# Outsmart Your Brain (book)

## üîóConnect
üîºTopic:: [Learning (MOC)](/mocs/learning-moc.md)


## ‚úíÔ∏è Note-Making

### üí°Clarify
üîà *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Learning is challenging ourselves** - our brain always searches for the simplest solution, but learning is hard, and it needs to be hard in order to sink in.
2. **Learn with awareness** - prepare in advance, know what you are going to study, how you will study, and how you will learn from your mistakes to improve later on. Don't just try harder, try better.
3. **Memory are cues for thoughts** - memory in general and notes specifically are meant to be a cue that will trigger the original thought we had at that time. That means that when we take notes, we need to remember which cues triggered the thought in the first place, and how to "tag" the thought such that it will resurface with the same cue.
4. **Habits are key** - learning habits, and physical/mental health habits are essential for success and wellbeing
5. **You are not alone** - Other people are valuable resource that you can use to improve your learning process. Teachers, other students, parents, all those can give you new perspectives, better understanding, and support.
### üóíÔ∏èRelate

‚õì *Life lessons, action items*

### üîçCritique

‚úÖ *by following this method, what will happen?*
1. **Confidence** - confidence is built through successes and the right perspective. Both can be achieved through better learning practices
2. **Achievements** - most of the techniques in the book are meant to help you be a better learner
3. **Loving learning** - similarly to confidence, between interested in a topic is not always the reason for our learning, but rather it's outcome.

‚ùå *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*

üß± *Implementations and limitations of it are...*
1. **college learning** - This book is targeted to students, perhaps undergraduates, and it is not always easy to convert the recommendations to a lifelong learner.
2. **Practice driven** - if you were looking for a deep analysis on learning, you won't find it here, it is mainly a collection of tips, a manual for learners, with a 1-2 pages introduction to each chapter.
### üó®Ô∏èReview

üí≠ *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
1. **summaries** - I really liked the "in a sentence" at the end of each tip, it helped highlighting and understanding the message
2. **Repetitiveness** - some of the content is repetitive just with a slight change in how it is presented to match the topic of the chapter, for example sleep was recommended many times.

## üìí Notes

### Introduction

Against common beliefs, learning is not a matter of repetition [spaced repetition](/notes/spaced-repetition.md) and not even our desire to learn, after all, we know a lot of things that are "irrelevant/uninteresting", but also we miss things that we encounter daily.

The main issue is the [learning should be hard](/notes/learning-should-be-hard.md), **while our brain will push us towards easy exercises to get satisfaction from false success, we must choose the harder exercise that will bring the larger benefit in the long run,** even if right now we are frustrated and feel like we're not progressing

### Chapter 1 - how to Understand a Lecture

**People try to convey maximum meaning in the easiest way possible**. That's why we more often communicate in an abbreviate way, assuming that others are able to connect the dots. [We can't read minds](/notes/theory-of-mind.md).

Like saying "I called dominos an hour ago, where's my phone?"
These sentences assume that:
1. We know what dominos is
2. that we have made an order
3. that an hour is too long to wait
4. that calling them is our way of solving the problem

More has been unsaid than said. The meaning is based on [context](/notes/context.md).

There are two types of understanding:
1. Vocabulary
2. connections

Usually, misunderstandings of the first type are much more noticeable, we are aware that we don't recognize a word. But in the second type, **errors are happening when we assume connections that are different from what the instructor meant, or miss connections all together**. [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md)

Tips:
1. **Structure** - analyze what you hear based on the overall structure of the lecture. What is the main theme/questions, and which supporting claims were made? [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md)
2. **Active listening** - don't treat the lecture as a movie. Always pay attention and relate what you hear the what you know, and to the main question of the lecture. [Active Listening](/notes/active-listening.md)
3. **Take notes** - by writing your thoughts in your own words, you are much more likely to remember and understand the material. [Distillment](/notes/distillment.md)
4. **Ask good questions** - seek to understand, especially clarification questions are never wrong to ask. [Proactiveness](/notes/proactiveness.md)

:::note[Quote]

- We always omit information when we speak. If we didn‚Äôt, communication would be really long and really boring. ([Location¬†134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=134))
- now we see how you might fail to understand something but not perceive that you don‚Äôt understand: you make a connection between ideas, so you think you‚Äôve got it, but the instructor wants you to connect them in another way. ([Location¬†151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=151))
- lectures are planned and organized hierarchically. Therefore, it‚Äôs not just possible that an idea connects to something mentioned twenty minutes ago, it‚Äôs likely, and if a student misses that connection, she will miss a layer of meaning. ([Location¬†170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=170))
- Expect that lectures will be hierarchically organized, and try to extract the organization during the lecture. ([Location¬†219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=219))
- Learning by listening takes work, ([Location¬†239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=239))
- First, just writing things down makes them more memorable. Second, reading your notes later jogs your memory. ([Location¬†244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=244))
- If the speaker provides notes or an outline, use them to aid your comprehension before or after the lecture, but don‚Äôt consider them a replacement for your own notes. ([Location¬†263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=263))

:::

### Chapter 2 - how to Take Notes

Since [Multitasking doesnt exist](/notes/multitasking-doesnt-exist.md), writing notes during a lecture between understanding and recording.
1. **On fact-heavy presentations, prefer speed on understanding and write more**, but never word by word, digest it first, write in your own words.
2. **On complicated lectures, first listen and understand**, then write a short summary of what you understood.
3. **Think about future you** - what would help you understand better when you have forgotten the topic
4. **Use abbreviations** - both for words and for hints, like comments, differentiation between your words and the speakers, rebuttal, etc [Mental Shortcuts](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md)
5. **Review** - go over your notes at the end of class, see if something needs adjustments, adding content, etc

:::note[Quote]

- the three mental processes that you will likely shortchange in an effort to write faster all concern understanding: understanding ideas, evaluating their importance, and paraphrasing them. As you feel the pressure of falling behind in note taking, your brain drifts toward writing more and understanding less. ([Location¬†388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=388))
- If you want to emphasize getting as much information into your notes as possible, your strategy is straightforward: write as fast as you can, and don‚Äôt worry too much about deep understanding or phrasing things in your own words. That said, never write anything that you don‚Äôt understand ([Location¬†450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=450))
- The easiest strategy is to understand what the speaker is saying, then write what you‚Äôre thinking, not what the speaker said. ([Location¬†457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=457))
- Write your notes for future you. Future you needs context and explanation, which are not easy to provide when you are rushed during a lecture. Also, you don‚Äôt want to go too far in the other direction, providing details when they are not needed. ([Location¬†514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=514))
- Evaluate your notes as you take them, to see if they will make sense to you later. ([Location¬†528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=528))
- Reduce the mental burden of note taking by using your own abbreviations. ([Location¬†593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=593))

### Chapter 3 -activities

Activities can have one of three possible goals:
1 - **process**. To understand the steps needed to perform a certain process. Usually this is a hands on activity, like how to play the guitar
2 - **experience**. In this case the activity is simply instrumental to the goal. Like walking in a forest to connect to nature. A forest is just a tool meant to create a certain experience, an emotional state or a change in perspective
3 - **concept**. To give a more physical example of a concept, to make it less abstract. Like jumping in water vs regular jumping to understand air resistance and gravity

Knowing the goal in advance is key to learn more from the activity, because
Of two aspects:
1. **Focus** - we remember what we focus on, and different goals mean different aspects of the activity that we should focus on. [Focus](/notes/focus.md)
2. **Mental tagging** - when we create memories, we "tag" them based on the context in which the thought arise. Knowing what we are expected to get out of the lecture will help us make better notes and mental images that will resurface in the right time

:::note[Quote]

- selecting the right features of an activity to pay attention to is essential because it determines what you‚Äôll learn from it. ([Location¬†695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=695))
- When the activity is an analogy, focus on the mapping. The mapping is the pairing of the features of the something you already understand with the features of the something you are trying to understand. ([Location¬†749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=749))
- If the purpose of the activity is to improve your performance of the activity, simply doing it repeatedly isn‚Äôt enough; improvement requires deliberate practice. ([Location¬†860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=860))
- If the purpose of the activity is to experience something because you cannot learn about it any other way, plan for what you will observe, because the experience may be so absorbing that you‚Äôll otherwise take little away from it. ([Location¬†877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=877))

### Chapter 4 - Organize Your Notes

On a regular basis, preferably as close to the lesson as possible, go over your notes.
Try to find the underlying theme that connects all the different points of the lecture. Find an organizing structure.
Share and compare notes with others, ask the teacher if needed, and even review the material.
Organization is the key for memorization.

:::note[Quote]

- Organization creates links among the bits and pieces of what you‚Äôre trying to remember. ([Location¬†971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=971))
- reorganizing your notes doesn‚Äôt just make it easier to study; the process of reorganizing notes is itself studying ([Location¬†988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=988))

### Chapter 5 - how to Read a Book

Reading and understanding a book is not the same thing. **The worst we can do while reading is not paying attention**. While it is easy to notice words we don't understand, it is hard to notice connections that we've missed. That's why highlighting is problematic because we assume we understand the book the first time, so our highlights will serve us the second them.

As a solution, he suggests the [sq3r](/notes/reading-methods.md) method:

Only by being prepared and by being active while reading we have a chance of understanding the book.

:::note[Quote]

- How can you be sure that you are highlighting the most important information if your understanding is hit-or-miss in the first place? ([Location¬†1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1200))
- Good reading strategies prompt you to think about the content and set concrete goals for what you‚Äôre to learn before you read, and to connect ideas as you read. ([Location¬†1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1262))

:::

### Chapter 6 - how to Prepare for an Exam

1. **Write a study guide** - understand what will be the main topics of the exam, what will be the structure, which type of questions, what level of detail is necessary, use past tests as an example
2. **Quiz yourself** - - test out your memory by simulating questions from the exam
3. **Review your knowledge base** - in case you created structured notes with good memory cues, reviewing it will be helpful
5. **Use others** - after a few sessions, meet with other and discuss your studies
6. **Mnemonics** - use meaningful connections or Mnemonics to remember the content

:::note[Quote]

- Use techniques that yield long-lasting memory‚Äîorganizing, thinking about meaning, and retrieval practice‚Äîeven though they feel difficult and seem less productive in the short run. ([Location¬†1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1378))
- Don‚Äôt use study materials created by someone else; they‚Äôre often inaccurate or incomplete, and creating your own is an excellent way to study. ([Location¬†1489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1489))
- Meaningless material is hard to remember, so taking a little extra time to make it meaningful ([Location¬†1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1516))
- Mnemonics help you memorize meaningless material, but they should be a last resort because it‚Äôs better to make content meaningful. ([Location¬†1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1545))
- Cramming ‚Äúworks‚Äù so long as you don‚Äôt care if you forget the information right after the exam. Distributed studying protects against this rapid forgetting. ([Location¬†1622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1622))

:::

### Chapter 7 - how to Know when You're Ready

Don't confuse between understanding the material and thinking you can recall it during the test.
**The best way to know you're ready is to have successful simulations**. I.e test yourself similar to how you will be tested. [Simulations](/notes/simulations.md)
Remember that you can be questioned on anything, so don't just use past tests as an example, since they contain but a fraction of the entire course material.

:::note[Quote]

- Being ready for a test means being able to explain content yourself, not just understanding it when someone else explains it. ([Location¬†1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1775))
- being familiar with something doesn‚Äôt mean you can recall it from memory and provide other, related information, ([Location¬†1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1810))
- don‚Äôt use old tests to measure whether you‚Äôve done enough studying. Judge whether you‚Äôre ready for a test by how well you know the content of the study guide you‚Äôve written. ([Location¬†1854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1854))
- Don‚Äôt study until you know the content and then stop; keep studying a little longer to protect against the forgetting that will happen during the time between when you stop studying and when you take the test. ([Location¬†1877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=1877))

:::

### Chapter 8 - how to Take Tests

**Most importantly, focus on your mental and physical energy**. Have enough sleep, relax.
During the test, spend a few minutes to go though the structure of the test, and keep a few minutes in the end to review what you've wrote.

When you approach a question, first read it fully, make sure you understand exactly the request. Then, don't just start writing, prepare a draft for answering it (a mind-map/brainstorming of ideas), the structure of start-middle-end.

**Don't overthink, and don't stress out**. Answers don't always come up at the first minute, so keep trying. Focus on themes and the larger picture, if facts don't come up.

### Chapter 9 - how to Learn from Your Mistakes

First, it's important to understand which type of a mistake you've made. The options usually are:
1. The question was unexpected
2. No possible answer looked right
3. You couldn't recall the answer during the test (but do now)
4. You remembered facts, but not how it connects to the question
5. You misread the question
6. You don't understand why your answer was wrong
7. You overthought (overcomplecated)

each type of mistake can point you to where exactly your studies is lacking. Is it in the preparation of the study guide? in the way you take the test? etc...

:::note[Quote]

- Analyze the reasons you got questions wrong by considering what you were thinking when you tried to answer them; that will tell you which step went wrong when you prepared for and then took the exam. ([Location¬†2287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=2287))
- Going over exam mistakes may make you feel dumb, but you‚Äôre actually doing what smart people do. ([Location¬†2427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=2427))

### Chapter 10 - how to Plan Your Work.

In short - habits, habits, habits.
Both in terms of keystone habits, like sleeping, but also specifically having a regular, recurring study session in your calendar. This is a dedicated study time that shouldn't be interrupted. Have a to-do list of tasks that you want to complete during your study sessions, and block more time if necessary.
In addition, have a study plan, which will take into account all your expected tasks in the next months, so you will never be caught off guard.

:::note[Quote]

- People consistently underestimate how long it will take to get things done. ([Location¬†2481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=2481))
- ‚ÄúPlans are of little importance, but planning is essential.‚Äù Churchill meant that the specific plans you draw up will almost certainly have to change because circumstances will change. But you will still benefit from planning because you will have thought about your goals, your capabilities, and the resources available to you.

### Chapter 11 - how to Avoid Procrastination

We procrastinate the most when we relay on our willpower [willpower is limited](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md). When we make our study session a habit, it will be easier to start it in the first place.
Other methods to keep us from procrastination are:
1. **Small steps** - [start small](/notes/start-small.md). Don't try to finish all at once, think about the smallest step that you can do right now to help you advance. This is combined with the [5 minute rule](/notes/5-minute-rule.md)
2. **Clarity** - the more you define your tasks, especially breaking it down to specific, tangible tasks, the easier it will be. [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md)
3. **Accountability** - have others support you, whether by giving you advice, or by holding you accountable to have your study sessions. [Accountability](/notes/accountability.md).
4. **Rewards** - [temptation bundling](/notes/temptation-bundling.md). Have a reward for finishing your task. Make it enticing to do it.

:::note[Quote]

- your ultimate goal is to defeat procrastination by making work a habit. ([Location¬†2790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=2790))
- Make each to-do list item doable‚Äîbetween twenty and sixty minutes long‚Äîbecause procrastination will be less tempting if tasks look achievable. ([Location¬†2871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=2871))
- Your social network may provide emotional support and practical help in your effort to procrastinate less, but to do so, people must know that you‚Äôre working on it and what sort of help you need. ([Location¬†2951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=2951))
- intelligence can be improved, and learning is the way to improve it. ([Location¬†2967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JPJVSBK&location=2967))

### Chapter 12 - how to Keep Focus

1. **Plan your environment** - control the cues in your environment. Go and study in a quiet place. [Nudge](/notes/nudge.md)
2. **Friction** - Make distractions harder to follow. [Friction](/notes/friction.md)
3. **Distancing** - ask yourself in 3rd person what should you do now? [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md)
4. **multitasking is a myth** - doing two things at once will rob you of your focus for both
5. **take breaks** - things like pomodoro can help you maintain focus during the work. Have scheduled breaks, fill up your mental and emotional reserves. [Rest](/notes/rest.md)

:::note[Quote]

- If you‚Äôre distracted by something such as your phone, you can try reevaluating the importance of the distraction; for mind wandering, the best strategy is to talk about your situation and the desirable evaluation of the situation in the third person.

### Chapter 13 - how to Have Self Confidence

1. **Maintain** [growth mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md)
2. **Compare yourself to yourself**, not to others. [Perspective](/notes/subjective-reality.md)
3. **surround yourself with people who value learning** and education [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md)

:::note[Quote]

- your self-image is shaped, in part, by grades and other feedback you‚Äôve received over the years, but three other factors matter, too: who your friends are, who you compare yourself to, and the family values you grew up with.

1. **Acknowledge your feelings**
2. **Start small
3. **Convert anxiety to excitement** - (Related[Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md))
