## ✒️ Note-Making

### 💡Clarify
🔈 *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Play** - Play is not just fun, it's a way for us to test new ideas in way that supports and nurtures inner motivation
2. **Passion** - Harmonic passion can help us get into the zone, get lost in the moment of onenss with our art, combining both the motivation to act and the grit to follow through the difficult parts.
3. **Daydreaming** - It's important to let our minds rest and wander. While mindfulness is essential to reclaim our focus, some inspiration can only come when we don't try to focus on the problem
4. **Solitude** - By being alone we can tune in with ourselves and gain self awareness, to uncover and develop our innermost thoughts and feelings, instead of being pulled by the noise of the social environment we are in.
5. **Intuition** - Trust your gut, it is often the automated reaction of your processed knowledge.
6. **Openness** - Having more knowledge makes it easier for us to make new connections because each point of Knowledge can be seen as a bridge making other points closer to each other. So the more curious we are, the more creative we can become.
7. **Mindfulness** - Creativity requires the skill of observation, otherwise whatever we experience will go through unnoticed, and new knowledge will not be learned.
8. **Sensitivity** - By being connected with our emotions we enrich our lives
9. **Adversity** - To find meaning in the suffering and having a way to channel all the emotions we have bottled up is the way to grow out of and with the help of those traumas. Obstacles are our stepping stones for growth.
10. **Non-conformity** - Being creative requires having the courage to think differently, to escape the strong forces of conformism, to accept that being different involves making mistakes and failing over and over again.

## 📒 Notes

### Preface

Creativity is not a linear process, the final result will vary from what you plan because it involves constant reflection and adaptation on your work as it progresses.

### Introduction - Messy Minds

Creativity is hard to capture by it's very nature of uniqueness and difference, but what we can say that it's not simple.

Creativity is often the result of [complexity](/notes/complexity.md) and [multitude](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md). Through a messy back and forth [deliberation](/notes/deliberation.md) between all the different parts of ourselves, through self knowledge in a process to create order out of the [ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md) we experience, through risk taking and unconventional methods of [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md) and [connection making](/notes/coherentism.md) we are able to be creative. [resonance](/notes/resonance.md).

Creativity also requires of us to be [adaptable](/notes/adaptability.md), to be explorative, willing to see and consider many different viewpoints and ideas [diversity](/notes/diversity.md), to be non conformist [Conformism](/notes/social-environment.md), and to be able to unify those multitude of ideas into a single creation.

This can also be perceived as two forces of push and pull, of generating new ideas and filtering/modifying them. They are loosely connected to the [downtime brain](/notes/downtime-brain.md) that helps us generate new ideas (while they "stew" in the brain ) and the [Executive Attention Network](/notes/executive-attention-network.md) that helps us focus and examine our ideas in a critical way and [distill](/notes/distillment.md) the creative spark.

Creativity is best fulfilled when it's the result of having fun, of experiencing [flow](/notes/flow.md), not when we force ourselves to produce something but rather when we focus on the process itself [trust the process](/notes/trust-the-process.md).

:::note[Introduction: Messy Minds]

- Highly creative work blends together different elements and influences in the most novel, or unusual, way, and these wide-ranging states, traits, and behaviors frequently conflict with each other within the mind of the creative person, resulting in a great deal of internal and external tension throughout the creative process. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=224))
- creativity is not merely expertise or knowledge but is instead informed by a whole suite of intellectual, emotional, motivational, and ethical characteristics.19 The common strands that seemed to transcend all creative fields was an openness to one’s inner life, a preference for complexity and ambiguity, an unusually high tolerance for disorder and disarray, the ability to extract order from chaos, independence, unconventionality, and a willingness to take risks. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=269))
- This ability to adapt to changing circumstances with fluidity and flexibility is reflected in three main “super-factors” of personality that are highly correlated with creativity: plasticity, divergence, and convergence. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=301))
- Creative people seem to be particularly good at operating within a broad spectrum of personality traits and behaviors. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=317))
- Those who derive enjoyment from the act of creating and feel in control of their creative process tend to show greater creativity than those who are focused exclusively on the outcome of their work. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=402))
- it is precisely this ability to hold the self in all of its dimensional beauty that is the very core of creative achievement and creative fulfillment. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=452))

### Imaginative Play

[play](/notes/gamification.md) is not something we just do for fun, it is a way for us to learn important skills and develop. It is like [Simulations](/notes/simulations.md) where we practice our skills in a enjoyable and safe way, and it is great for [intrinsic motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md). Imagination is key for [creativity](/notes/ideation.md), and it mostly the result of unrestricted play.

At a younger age, it's better to focus on developing free play rather than specific knowledge such as math or reading. Let them develop the capabilities and motivation for learning better later on.

### Passion

[passion](/notes/passion.md) is key for both productivity and creativity. Passion brings intrinsic motivation towards a certain field, giving us both an inspiration, a spark of motivation to start a project, believing we can achieve it [optimism](/notes/optimism.md) and the necessary [grit](/notes/grit.md) to follow through with the difficulties it brings. Harmonic passion helps us become one with the skill, feeling flow and allowing ourselves to grow in the process [growth mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md). It is not only to have a dream about a better future self, but also to love the process that will get us there. Meanwhile obsessive passion is more possessive. We are compelled to do it to retain the status quo, without any desire for something to change [fixed mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md).

:::note[Passion]

- A love of one’s work is key to not only productivity but also high-level creativity. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=699))
- Harmoniously passionate people are impelled to create, whereas obsessively passionate people are compelled to create by more extrinsic factors. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=746))
- what makes an object inspiring is its perceived subjective value—not how much it’s objectively worth or how attainable it is. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=785))
- To nourish and sustain motivation toward a creative goal, we must not only fall in love with a dream of our future self, as Torrance says, but also love the process of becoming that person—including all the unglamorous, everyday hard work. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=818))
- Grit, optimism, passion, and hope are all strategies that we use to help us achieve our goals. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=834))

### Daydreaming

It's important to let our minds rest and wander. While [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md) is essential to reclaim our focus, some inspiration can only come when we don't try to focus on the problem [The law of reverse effect](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md). By day dreaming, taking a [nature walk](/notes/nature-walk.md), or even a shower we can relax our brain and let new connections be formed by our subconscious that wasn't possible through our conscious thoughts.

:::note[Daydreaming]

- Creative work requires a connection to one’s inner monologue, and it is from this stream of desires, emotions, and ways of making sense of the world that new ideas and novel perspectives arise. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=914))
- Finding this “middle way” between mindfulness and mind wandering can help us enjoy optimal benefits of both ways of thinking. Mindfulness helps us truly see what’s around us—a skill of paramount importance in life and art—but it must be balanced with giving the mind space to dream, fantasize, and simply roam free. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=1054))

:::


### Solitude

We are highly sensitive to the social world around us [social environment](/notes/social-environment.md). When we are surrounded by people, it blocks us from hearing our inner voice, and our attention is devoted to others or to our social status.

That's why [Solitude](/notes/solitude.md) is essential to the creative process, especially the first part of generating ideas. By being alone we can tune in with ourselves and gain [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md), to uncover and develop our innermost thoughts and feelings, resulting in knowledge that can be converted to our creation.

:::note[Solitude]

- In order to make art, we must find the space to become intimate with our own minds. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=1079))

:::


### Intuition

[intuition](/notes/intuition.md) is a great undervalued source of creative thinking. It can be perceived as the conversion of knowledge from [system 2](/notes/system-2.md) into automated [system 1](/notes/system-1.md) decision making. While it is subconscious in some level, we can trigger or be more aware of our intuitions, for example:
1. Experiencing all the range of emotions - emotions, both negative and positive are a useful tool of information. Being aware of them and processing them, listen to them and trying to understand what caused them can be a good source of information [Emotions as decision heuristics](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md)
2. Insightful questions - some riddles can spark the creative bug within us, forcing ourselves to think creatively about a problem
3. Shutting down some senses - like how closing your eyes can allow you to imagine the problem differently in your head, sometimes by removing some of the noise we experience we can notice our intuitions better.

:::note[Intuition]

- it is becoming quite clear that intense emotions—both positive and negative—can lead to creative insights. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=1512))

:::


### Openness to Experience

Since creativity is connection making, the more points of information we have, and the better connected the are, the more creative we can be.

To increase our information, we need to be open to new experiences [curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md), for example:
1. Intellectual curiosity - to pursue truth
2. Emotional curiosity - to understand better the richness of human emotions
3. Aesthetic curiosity - to seek beauty in all it's forms

Having more knowledge makes it easier for us to make new connections because each point of Knowledge can be seen as a bridge making other points closer to each other. It can also helps us see the same information in a new light, create new [Analogies](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md) that deepen out knowledge and making it more connected.

:::note[Openness to Experience]

- We need new and unusual experiences to think differently. In fact, cultivating a mind-set that is open and explorative might be the best thing we can do for our creative work. ([Location 1594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=1594))
- Very likely, taking in a greater volume of information increases your chances of making new and unusual connections between distantly related information. ([Location 1687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=1687))

:::


### Mindfulness

Creativity requires the skill of observation, otherwise whatever we experience will go through unnoticed. To observe, we need both the ability to silence the noise and to focus on the experience, both are the result of mindfulness. While mindfulness is important, we can't be 100% focused all the time, because as we said we also need time for daydreaming.

:::note[Mindfulness]

- Creativity requires a balance of external focus with more inner-focused, free imagination network processes like future thinking, reflection, introspection, and memory consolidation. ([Location 2049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=2049))
- For optimum cognitive flexibility and creativity, it’s best to achieve a balance of mindfulness and mind wandering. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=2057))
- To be creative, you need to have, or be trained in, the ability to carefully observe, notice, or attend to phenomena that pass your mind’s eye.” ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=2139))

:::


### Sensitivity

It's not enough to be open to experiences, it's not enough to be mindful of them, we have to feel it [experience knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md). By being connected with our emotions we enrich our lives. There are many types of sensitivity, from intellectual, to imaginative, sensitive, etc.

:::note[Sensitivity]

- Sensitivity, intensity, and inner conflict are required for us to transcend to greater levels of growth, self-awareness, and compassion. ([Location 2417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=2417))

:::


### Turning Adversity into Advantage

A great source for internal knowledge and growth are adversities [Post Traumatic Growth](/notes/creative-destruction.md). While unfortunate, these events are often so shocking and destabilizing that we are able to overcome [path dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md), see ourselves in a new light and set in a new direction. This step of "rebuilding" is hard but essential. To find meaning in the suffering and having a way to channel all the emotions we have bottled up is the way to grow out of and with the help of those traumas. Art is often a useful tool for challenging these emotions.

:::note[Turning Adversity into Advantage]

- Experiences of extreme adversity show us our own strength. And in the wake of trying times, many people not only return to their baseline state of functioning, but learn to truly thrive. ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=2489))

:::


### Thinking Differently

Being creative requires having the courage to think differently, to escape the strong forces of conformism, to accept that being different involves making mistakes and failing over and over again. Creativity is not a matter of [perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md), it will take make tries until we get something right [first batch trash](/notes/first-batch-trash.md) so it's not a matter of quality but rather quantity. Creativity is a matter of approach, rather than the singular act of bringing something into existence. It's to look at things differently, to be explorative and open minded.

:::note[Thinking Differently]

- the most original contributions in any field are unlikely to result from efforts to please the crowd. ([Location 2768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=2768))
- the quality of creative ideas is a positive function of quantity: The more ideas creators generate (regardless of the quality of each idea), the greater the chances they would produce an eventual masterpiece.33 ([Location 2940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=2940))
- Doing things differently sometimes involves doing things badly or wrong. ([Location 2976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=2976))
- Perception, and therefore imagination, is limited by the categories that we’ve learned from our past experiences. ([Location 2998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=2998))
- Creativity isn’t just about innovating or making art—it’s about living creatively. We can approach any situation in life with a creative spirit. ([Location 3048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI02E62&location=3048))
