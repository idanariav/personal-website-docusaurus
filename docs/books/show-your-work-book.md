## üìí Notes

### You Don't Have to Be a Genius

You don't just need to do good work, you also have to be hears. Self promotion is less fake than we realize, it is to put yourself out there, the entirety of you.

It is to learn with others, not showing that you're an expert [peer support](/notes/peer-support.md). Genius is not a lone person, it is created through shared learning.

Once you find your voice, keep on expressing it, until people who are looking for you find you.

### Think Process, not Product

The process you use to create the product can be more interesting and useful than the product itself. For example, a painter can either show his paintings, or how he paints.

Sharing the process can be scary, but this [Vulnerability](/notes/vulnerability.md) is what leads to a connection with your audience.

[documenting](/notes/journaling.md) your work process will help you find the hidden insights of your work.

### Share Something Small Every Day

It is helpful to be [conssitent](/notes/consistency.md), to share your work everyday. But remember that the goal of your posts is to provide value. Showing something half baked is relevant if you're looking for feedback, but don't share everything. Your posts are another tool at your disposal, use wisely.

Social media is nice, but have your own domain online, a place where you can design and express freelyly.

### Open up Your Cabinet of Curiosities

Consume interesting content such that it will feed your creativity, follow your [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md). There's no such thing as [guilty](/notes/guilt.md) pleasure, don't judge what you consume and why. If you like it, go after it with your whole heart.

### Tell Good Stories

There's value in [Storytelling](/notes/storytelling.md), it provides the framework that will help the audience value and enjoy your work. It can't come on it's own, you have to wrap your work in a story. A good story is one that easily connects to the audience, that knows their language, their preferences, their style. A good story has a structure, something to follow from start to end.

While stories should be captivating, don't invent fiction. Stick to the truth, be honest and open, don't exaggerate, and describe yourself in a non flattering way.

### Teach what You Know

Sharing what you know helps other people connect to you, and essentially this is what they're after, to be better at something they want to improve at. This won't create competition because it is your speciality that has created these instructions, and this is hard to imitate.

### Don't Turn into Human Spam

If you want to be interesting, first you should be interested. Be a member of the community before trying to lead it, participate in debates, respond to others, show interest, do your research instead of just writing your opinions.

### Learn how to Take a Punch

Eventually you will receive [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md), whether you like it or not. Remember that [what you do is not who you are](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md), it doesn't define you, but use it to make you better. And don't listen to the trolls, learn to [filter](/notes/filtering.md) who's opinions really matter.

### Sell out

Once you're confident in the value you're providing, and have a large audience, don't be afraid converting it to paying patrons. It's not a shame to ask for money to support what you do, we all need to live.

Have an emailing list, this is the best way of converting people who are interested in what you do to paying customers.

Be as [generous](/notes/giving.md) as you can, if you found success, pay tribute to those who helped you get there, and those who wish to be there, yet don't let it interrupt your work.
### Stick around

Creativity is all a matter of [Grit](/notes/grit.md), you have to persist even when it's hard, especially when it's hard. Good creative work doesn't come [easy](/notes/first-batch-trash.md), you have to dig deep, replace or cover up what you've done so far, so that you could be free to create something better.
