# Ultralearning (book)

## ✒️ Note-Making

### 🔗Connect
🔼Topic:: [Learning (Map)](/mocs/learning-map.md)

### 💡Clarify
🔈 *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Create a learning map** - research what, why and how you are going to learn
2. **Practice practice practice** - try to simulate as best as possible the conditions of the "real life cases" of what you'll do with your gained knowledge during the learning process. Practice it again and again, specifically the hard part, until you will have a solid foundation and have a sense of intuition.
3. **Explore alternatives** - try to get good feedback to show you where you are wrong or what you could better. Experiment to find better alternatives yourself and step out of your comfort zone

## 📒 Notes

### Intro

Ultra-learning is something anyone can do, its not about skill or IQ.

:::note[Why Ultralearning Matters]

- Ultralearning: A strategy for acquiring skills and knowledge that is both self-directed and intense.
- rapidly learning hard skills can have a greater impact than years of mediocre striving on the job.
- Your deepest moments of happiness don’t come from doing easy things; they come from realizing your potential and overcoming your own limiting beliefs about yourself.
- many of the assumptions embedded in our culture about what is necessary to live a successful, middle-class lifestyle are quickly eroding. With the disappearance of medium-skilled jobs, it’s not enough to get a basic education and work hard every day in order to succeed. Instead, you need to move into the higher-skilled category, where learning is constant, or you’ll be pushed into the lower-skilled category at the bottom.
- Ultralearning, because it is directed by learners themselves, can fit into a wider variety of schedules and situations, targeting exactly what you need to learn without the waste.
- I believe there are three main cases in which this strategy for quickly acquiring hard skills can apply: accelerating the career you have, transitioning to a new career, and cultivating a hidden advantage in a competitive world.
- The best ultralearners are those who blend the practical reasons for learning a skill with an inspiration that comes from something that excites them.
- The core of the ultralearning strategy is intensity and a willingness to prioritize effectiveness. Whether this happens on a full-time schedule or just a couple hours per week is completely up to you.
- Ultralearning doesn’t have to be an additional activity; it can inform the time you already spend learning.

:::note[How to Become an Ultralearner]

- not only that you can become an ultralearner but that such successes are far from being the inevitable consequences of having a particular kind of genius or talent.
- it’s possible to decide to become an ultralearner. But ultralearning isn’t a cookie-cutter method. Every project is unique, and so are the methods needed to master it.
- Ultralearning, in my view, works best when you see it through a simple set of principles, rather than trying to copy and paste exact steps or protocols.
- Metalearning: First Draw a Map. Start by learning how to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle. Discover how to do good research and how to draw on your past competencies to learn new skills more easily. Focus: Sharpen Your Knife. Cultivate the ability to concentrate. Carve out chunks of time when you can focus on learning, and make it easy to just do it. Directness: Go Straight Ahead. Learn by doing the thing you want to become good at. Don’t trade it off for other tasks, just because those are more convenient or comfortable. Drill: Attack Your Weakest Point. Be ruthless in improving your weakest points. Break down complex skills into small parts; then master those parts and build them back together again. Retrieval: Test to Learn. Testing isn’t simply a way of assessing knowledge but a way of creating it. Test yourself before you feel confident, and push yourself to actively recall information rather than passively review it. Feedback: Don’t Dodge the Punches. Feedback is harsh and uncomfortable. Know how to use it without letting your ego get in the way. Extract the signal from the noise, so you know what to pay attention to and what to ignore. Retention: Don’t Fill a Leaky Bucket. Understand what you forget and why. Learn to remember things not just for now but forever. Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building Up. Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills. Understand how understanding works, and don’t recourse to cheap tricks of memorization to avoid deeply knowing things. Experimentation: Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone. All of these principles are only starting points. True mastery comes not just from following the path trodden by others but from exploring possibilities they haven’t yet imagined.
- deciding what you want to learn, how you want to learn it, and crafting your own plan to learn what you need to. You’re the one in charge, and you’re the one who’s ultimately responsible for the results you generate.

:::


### Chapter 1 - Meta-learning: First Draw a Map

Before starting the actual learning, its helpful to plan how the learning itself would look like, by creating a *learning map*. [Planning](/notes/planning.md) this includes the *what*, *why*, and *how*.
**Why** - what is your goal? what are you trying to achieve? which capability? For example, if I want to learn a language just to "get by" while being a tourist, its likely that I wont need to focus on writing.
**What** - derives from the "why", and focused on *concepts, facts and processes* in that field of knowledge. Based on these aspects, you need to find what is the optimal learning method.
**How** - this is that optimal learning method. Its best to consult with people who learned the subject or experts in the field.

:::note[Metalearning First Draw a Map]

- metalearning—not learning about the object of your inquiry itself, in this case words and phrases, but learning about how knowledge is structured and acquired within this subject; in other words, learning how to learn it.
- Metalearning thus forms the map, showing you how to get to your destination without getting lost.
- Over the short term, you can do research to focus on improving your metalearning before and during a learning project.
- A good ultralearning project, with excellent materials and an awareness of what needs to be learned, has the potential to be completed faster than formal schooling.
- Over the long term, the more ultralearning projects you do, the larger your set of general metalearning skills will be. You’ll know what your capacity is for learning, how you can best schedule your time and manage your motivation, and you’ll have well-tested strategies for dealing with common problems.
- “Why?,” “What?,” and “How?” “Why?” refers to understanding your motivation to learn. If you know exactly why you want to learn a skill or subject, you can save a lot of time by focusing your project on exactly what matters most to you. “What?” refers to the knowledge and abilities you’ll need to acquire in order to be successful. Breaking things down into concepts, facts, and procedures can enable you to map out what obstacles you’ll face and how best to overcome them. “How?” refers to the resources, environment, and methods you’ll use when learning.
- If you’re pursuing a project for mostly instrumental reasons, it’s often a good idea to do an additional step of research: determining whether learning the skill or topic in question will actually help you achieve your goal.
- The main way you can do research of this kind is to talk to people who have already achieved what you want to achieve.
- you can start looking at how the knowledge in your subject is structured. A good way to do this is to write down on a sheet of paper three columns with the headings “Concepts,” “Facts,” and “Procedures.” Then brainstorm all the things you’ll need to learn.
- Concepts are ideas that you need to understand in flexible ways in order for them to be useful.
- Facts are anything that suffices if you can remember them at all. You don’t need to understand them too deeply, so long as you can recall them in the right situations.
- Procedures are actions that need to be performed and may not involve much conscious thinking at all.
- underline the concepts, facts, and procedures that are going to be most challenging. This will give you a good idea what the major learning bottlenecks are going to be and can start you searching for methods and resources to overcome those difficulties.
- The way to start any learning project is by finding the common ways in which people learn the skill or subject. This can help you design a default strategy as a starting point.
- An hour spent searching online for almost any skill should turn up courses, articles, and recommendations for how to learn it. Investing the time here can have incredible benefits because the quality of the materials you use can create orders-of-magnitude differences in your effectiveness. Even if you’re eager to start learning right away, investing a few hours now can save you dozens or hundreds later on.
- Once you’ve found a default curriculum, you can consider making modifications to it.
- The Emphasize/Exclude Method involves first finding areas of study that align with the goals you identified in the first part of your research.
- The second part of the Emphasize/Exclude Method is to omit or delay elements of your benchmarked curriculum that don’t align with your goals.
- A good rule of thumb is that you should invest approximately 10 percent of your total expected learning time into research prior to starting.
- The goal here isn’t to exhaust every learning possibility but simply to make sure you haven’t latched onto the first possible resource or method without thinking through alternatives.
- Metalearning research isn’t a onetime activity you do only before starting your project. You should continue to do research as you learn more.

:::


### Chapter 2 - Focus: Sharpen Your Knife
Focus has three main parts, Beginning, Continuous, and quality. [Focus](/notes/focus.md)
1. **Beginning** - some people face issues with getting themselves to sit down and start focusing on a task, usually due to [Procrastination](/notes/procrastination.md), a simple solution might be [5 minute rule](/notes/5-minute-rule.md), just try to start for five minutes.
2. **Continuous** - reducing distractions and trying to develop [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md) to jeep the head clear without distracting thoughts.
3. **Quality** - Complicated tasks require a different level of concentration. For example, I can solve mathematical problems while listening to music, but not reading while doing so. This is related to the level of awareness, so a different task might be optimal during different parts of the day [motivational scheduling](/notes/motivational-scheduling.md)

:::note[Focus Sharpen Your Knife]

- struggles with focus that people have generally come in three broad varieties: starting, sustaining, and optimizing the quality of one’s focus.
- Recognizing that you’re procrastinating is the first step to avoiding it. Make a mental habit of every time you procrastinate; try to recognize that you are feeling some desire not to do that task or a stronger desire to do something else.
- a good first crutch is to convince yourself to get over just the few minutes of maximal unpleasantness before you take a break.
- If this is the case and your problem has switched from being unable to get started to taking breaks too often, you can try something a little harder, say the Pomodoro Technique:
- if working on your project is not troubled by extreme procrastination, you may want to switch to using a calendar on which you carve out specific hours of your day in advance to work on the project. This approach allows you to make the best use of your limited time.
- Your goal is to enhance your learning, and this often involves pushing through some sessions that are more frustrating than what could be considered ideal for flow.
- if you have several hours to study, you’re possibly better off covering a few topics rather than focusing exclusively on one. Doing so has trade-offs, however, so if your study time becomes more and more fractured, it may be difficult to learn at all.
- be aware of what environment you work best in, and test it.
- Whenever you have a choice between using different tools for learning, you may want to consider which is easier to focus on when making that decision.
- if you’re struggling with problems in your life, you’ll have a harder time learning well, and you may want to look at dealing with those first.
- Not working at all is unlikely to lead to creative genius, but taking a break may help breathe fresh perspective into a hard problem.
- Complex tasks may benefit from lower arousal, so working in a quiet room at home might be the right idea for math problems. Simpler tasks might benefit from a noisier environment,

:::


### Chapter 3 - Directedness: Go Straight ahead

learn both in terms of method and in terms of subjects exactly according to your goal. Want to become a musician? play the instrument. Want to learn a new language? start speaking it instead of listening to lectures. Want to become a coder? have a coding project. [Simulations](/notes/simulations.md)

Directedness is the best way to learn because:
1. **There is a higher change that you will acquire the tools and skills that you would actually need "in real life"**. compare for example a degree in college that is detached and completely unrelated from the needs of the industry, as opposed to an "on-the-job training".
2. There is a higher chance that you will be able to implement the knowledge in new contexts. [Transferred Learning](/notes/transferred-learning.md). This is the ultimate goal of every educational system, to prepare you to *new* situations that you will encounter in the future.

:::note[Directness Go Straight Ahead]

- Directness is the idea of learning being tied closely to the situation or context you want to use it in.
- many of us are building the wrong portfolio of skills for the kinds of career and personal achievements we want to create.
- Though first covering the material is often essential to begin doing practice, the principle of directness asserts that it’s actually while doing the thing you want to get good at when much of learning takes place.
- The easiest way to learn directly is to simply spend a lot of time doing the thing you want to become good at. If you want to learn a language, speak it,
- transfer really embodies something we expect of almost all learning efforts—that we’ll be able to use something we study in one situation and apply it to a new situation. Anything less than this is hard to describe as learning at all.
- transfer tends to be harder when our knowledge is more limited. As we develop more knowledge and skill in an area, they become more flexible and easier to apply outside the narrow contexts in which they were learned.
- most formal learning is woefully indirect.
- Directness solves the problem of transfer in two ways. The first and most obvious is that if you learn with a direct connection to the area in which you eventually want to apply the skill, the need for far transfer is significantly reduced.
- By learning in a real context, one also learns many of the hidden details and skills that are far more likely to transfer to a new real-life situation than from the artificial environment of a classroom.
- The simplest way to be direct is to learn by doing.
- if you organize your learning around producing something, you’re guaranteed to at least learn how to produce that thing. If you take classes, you may spend a lot of time taking notes and reading but not achieve your goal.
- you can apply immersion to learn more. Joining communities of people who are actively engaged in learning can have a similar impact, since it encourages constant exposure to new ideas and challenges.
- when direct practice is impossible, a simulation of the environment will work to the degree to which it remains faithful to the cognitive elements of the task in question.
- The overkill approach is to put yourself into an environment where the demands are going to be extremely high, so you’re unlikely to miss any important lessons or feedback.
- One way you can overkill a project is to aim for a particular test, performance, or challenge that will be above the skill level you strictly require.

:::


### Chapter 4 - Drill: Attack Your Weakest point

You must identify your weak spots, especially those we are a bottleneck to achieving your ultimate goal. For example to stutter during speeches, or forgetting how to conjugate verbs.
You have to practice those parts over and over until you'll improve. [Chunking](/notes/chunking.md)
**This is perhaps the most unrewarding and frustrating part about learning, but as a good building needs a solid base to stand on, you can't ignore your weak spots**. [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md). [learning should be hard](/notes/learning-should-be-hard.md)

:::note[Drill Attack Your Weakest Point]

- certain aspects of the learning problem forming a bottleneck that controls the speed at which you can become more proficient overall.
- By identifying a rate-determining step in your learning reaction, you can isolate it and work on it specifically. Since it governs the overall competence you have with that skill, by improving at it you will improve faster than if you try to practice every aspect of the skill at once.
- If direct practice involves working on a whole skill nearest to the situation in which it will eventually be used, drills are a pull in the opposite direction. A drill takes the direct practice and cuts it apart, so that you are practicing only an isolated component.
- The tension between learning directly and doing drills can be resolved when we see them as being alternating stages in a larger cycle of learning.
- The first step is to try to practice the skill directly. This means figuring out where and how the skill will be used and then trying to match that situation as close as is feasible when practicing.
- The next step is to analyze the direct skill and try to isolate components that are either rate-determining steps in your performance or subskills you find difficult to improve because there are too many other things going on for you to focus on them. From here you can develop drills and practice those components separately until you get better at them. The final step is to go back to direct practice and integrate what you’ve learned.
- You should focus on what aspects of the skill might be the rate-determining steps in your performance. Which aspect of the skill, if you improved it, would cause the greatest improvement to your abilities overall for the least amount of effort?
- Drills require the learner not only to think deeply about what is being learned but also figure out what is most difficult and attack that weakness directly rather than focus on what is the most fun or what has already been mastered. This requires strong motivation and a comfort with learning aggressively.

:::


### Chapter 5 - Retrieval: Test to Learn

Instead of reading the same text again and again, or working with the material next to you, challenge yourself by trying to remember what you've learn, in a certain interval after you learned it. For example, try to summarize the article you read the next day. Not only does it help you remember the materials better, but it also sets you up for better learning next time. This is exactly the point where studying is changed from memorization to a deeper understanding.

:::note[Retrieval Test to Learn]

- The act of trying to summon up knowledge from memory is a powerful learning tool on its own, beyond its connection to direct practice or feedback.
- Giving someone a test immediately after they learn something improves retention less than giving them a slight delay, long enough so that answers aren’t in mind when they need them. Difficulty, far from being an obstacle to making retrieval work, may be part of the reason it does so.
- Pushing difficulty higher and opting for testing oneself well before you are “ready” is more efficient.
- practicing retrieval might not only benefit from starting earlier than one is “ready” but even before you have the possibility of answering correctly.
- By forcing yourself to recall the main points and arguments, you’ll be able to remember them better later.

:::


### Chapter 6 - Feedback: Don't Dodge the Punches
There are three kinds of [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md):
1. **Result** - either a v/x (success or failure), or a score. This is only indicates the quality of your knowledge
2. **informative** - indicates exactly what you did or didn't do well, but not how to improve
3. **Constructive** - Indicates what went well and what didn't, but also includes steps for improvements. Usually it is provided by a teacher or a coach.
You should always aspire to receive constructive feedback, but its not always possible.
Also, you should know not to listen to each and every feedback, since that many signals usually contain [Noise](/notes/noise.md), and sometimes the feedback is not directed towards improvement, but rather hurting/complementing your ego as a person, which makes it irrelevant.

:::note[Feedback Don’t Dodge the Punches]

- What often separated the ultralearning strategy from more conventional approaches was the immediacy, accuracy, and intensity of the feedback being provided.
- Feedback works well when it provides useful information that can guide future learning. If feedback tells you what you’re doing wrong or how to fix it, it can be a potent tool. But feedback often backfires when it is aimed at a person’s ego.
- when seeking feedback, the ultralearner needs to be on guard for two possibilities. The first is overreacting to feedback (both positive and negative) that doesn’t offer specific information that leads to improvement.
- when it is incorrectly applied, feedback can have a negative impact on motivation. Not only can overly negative feedback lower your motivation, but so can overly positive feedback.
- Ultralearners acquire skills quickly because they seek aggressive feedback when others opt for practice that includes weaker forms of feedback or no feedback at all.
- The first type of feedback, and the least granular, is outcome feedback. This tells you something about how well you’re doing overall but offers no ideas as to what you’re doing better or worse.
- Although outcome feedback isn’t complete, it is often the only kind available and can still have a potent impact on your learning rate.
- informational feedback. This feedback tells you what you’re doing wrong, but it doesn’t necessarily tell you how to fix it.
- The best kind of feedback to get is corrective feedback. This is the feedback that shows you not only what you’re doing wrong but how to fix it.
- Anytime you receive feedback, there are going to be both a signal—the useful information you want to process—and noise. Noise is caused by random factors, which you shouldn’t overreact to when trying to improve.
- If your learning rate is slowing to a trickle, that might mean you’re hitting diminishing returns with your current approach and could benefit from different kinds of drills, difficulties, or environments. A second way you can apply metafeedback is by comparing two different study methods to see which works better.
- High-intensity, rapid feedback offers informational advantages, but more often the advantage is emotional, too. Fear of receiving feedback can often hold you back more than anything.
- Knowing that your work will be evaluated is an incredible motivator to do your best.

:::


### Chapter 7 - Retention: Don't Fill a Leaking Bucket.

Forgetting is a natural part of learning, but you can reduce it by:
1. **Spaced repetition** - going over the material again based on predefined internals. [spaced repetition](/notes/spaced-repetition.md)
2. **Procedural** - turning the new skill into something "automated" within you, like knowing how to ride a bike
3. **Over-practicing** - Learning more than it's needed won't improve the skill but will improve retention.
4. **Mnemonic devices** - like a [Memory Palace](/notes/memory-palace.md), or any other visual representation that help you remember what you've learned.

:::note[Retention Don’t Fill a Leaky Bucket]

- Our minds are a leaky bucket; however, most of the holes are near the top, so the water that remains at the bottom leaks out more slowly.
- vivid, meaningful things are more easily recalled than banal or arbitrary information.
- Proactive interference occurs when previously learned information makes acquiring new knowledge harder.
- Retroactive interference is the opposite—where learning something new “erases” or suppresses an old memory.
- You need to pick a mnemonic system, which will both accomplish your goals and be simple enough to stick to.
- Spreading learning sessions over more intervals over longer periods of time tends to cause somewhat lower performance in the short run (because there is a chance for forgetting between intervals) but much better performance in the long run.
- When it comes to retention, don’t let perfect become the enemy of good enough.
- This difference between knowing how and knowing that may also have different implications for long-term memory. Procedural skills, such as the ever-remembered bicycling, are much less susceptible to being forgotten than knowledge that requires explicit recall to retrieve.
- Instead of learning a large volume of knowledge or skills evenly, you may emphasize a core set of information much more frequently, so that it becomes procedural and is stored far longer.
- To retain knowledge is ultimately to combat the inevitable human tendency to forget. This process occurs in all of us, and there’s no way to avoid it completely. However, certain strategies—spacing, proceduralization, overlearning, and mnemonics—can counteract your short- and long-term rates of forgetting and end up making a huge difference in your memorization.

:::


### Chapter 8 - Intuition: Dig Deep before Building up

Intuition is a different, sub-concious level of understanding. It is not necessarily created by "over-practicing", but by a deeper understanding of the relevant subject. For example the [Feynman Technique](/notes/feynman-technique.md), which by forcing you to teach others what you've learned, enables you to understand the subject on a deeper level.
**Intuition will be formed if we would be able to recognize the logic, or leading cause behind what we've learning**, like being able to prove the mathematical equations you are using, or the grammatical rule instead of just remembering sentences. [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md) [Intuition](/notes/intuition.md)

:::note[Intuition Dig Deep Before Building Up]

- Only by developing enough experience with problem solving can you build up a deep mental model of how other problems work. Intuition sounds magical, but the reality may be more banal—the product of a large volume of organized experience dealing with the problem.
- Simply spending a lot of time studying something isn’t enough to create a deep intuition.
- One way you can introduce this into your own efforts is to give yourself a “struggle timer” as you work on problems. When you feel like giving up and that you can’t possibly figure out the solution to a difficult problem, try setting a timer for another ten minutes to push yourself a bit further.
- Asking whether you understand a concept is a lot harder because you may understand it a little, but not enough for the purposes at hand.
- This process of following along with one’s own example forces a deeper level of processing the material as it is being presented.
- it isn’t simply how much time you spend paying attention to information that determines what you retain but, crucially, how you think about that information while you pay attention to it.
- Explaining things clearly and asking “dumb” questions can keep you from fooling yourself into thinking you know something you don’t.
- Write down the concept or problem you want to understand at the top of a piece of paper. In the space below, explain the idea as if you had to teach it to someone else.
- When you get stuck, meaning your understanding fails to provide a clear answer, go back to your book, notes, teacher, or reference material to find the answer.

### Chapter 9 - Experimentation: Explore outside Your Comfort Zone

Improvement comes not only from learning the same subjects, but also by searching new ways to improve [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md). Whether by improving the learning methods (do I study better by using videos or books?) or by improving the ways in which the knowledge is implemented.
**Success is most often the result of innovation, and not just a good execution of the things that are easy to do**.
Trying new ways to solve problems, mixing skills from different fields, and being with a [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) is what will help you switch from a beginner to an expert.

:::note[Experimentation Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone]

- Experiments, however, needn’t always be successful to have value,
- as your skill develops, it’s often no longer enough to simply follow the examples of others; you need to experiment and find your own path.
- Getting better, however, increasingly becomes an act of unlearning; not only must you learn to solve problems you couldn’t before, you must unlearn stale and ineffective approaches for solving those problems.
- many skills reward not only proficiency but originality.
- Once you apply yourself aggressively to that new method, you can step back and evaluate how well it is working and whether you feel it makes sense to continue with that approach or try another.
- whereas the growth mindset encourages you to see opportunities and potential for improvement, experimentation enacts a plan to reach those improvements.
- Pushing out to an extreme in some aspect of the skill you’re cultivating, even if you eventually decide to pull it back to something more moderate, is often a good exploration strategy. This allows you to search the space of possibilities more effectively, while also giving you a broader range of experience.
- Copying exemplars, running tests, and pushing to extremes are all ways to push outside your ingrained habits and try out something different.
- Careful experimentation not only brings out your best potential, it also eliminates bad habits and superstitions by putting them to the test of real-world results.

:::


### Chapter 10 - Your First Ultra-learning Project
to plan an ultra-learning project:
1. **Set goals**:
	1. What do you want to learn
	2. Which resources can you use?
	3. How others have attempted to learn this subject
	4. Which drills will you preform
2. **Plan your sessions** - how much time are you going to dedicate to studying? which day of the week? its better to have multiple short sessions that a single long one.
3. **Plan your learning** - create your learning map based on all the components listed in this book, and implement it even if its not perfect
4. **review your results** - what when well, what didn't, what can I improve next time.
5. **Implementation** - how will you use what you've learn, otherwise it will fade.

:::note[Your First Ultralearning Project]

- Mastery is a long road that extends far beyond a single project. Sometimes the barriers you overcome in your initial effort are enough to clear the way for a slow process of accumulation to reach eventual mastery.
- Being an ultralearner doesn’t imply that everything one learns has to be done in the most aggressive and dramatic fashion possible.
- Habits tend to work best when the act of learning is mostly a process of accumulation, adding new skills and knowledge. Ultralearning and more deliberate efforts are better suited to when improvement in a field requires unlearning ineffective behaviors or skills.
- Ultralearning also tends to be better for areas in which learning has greater frustration barriers and psychological obstacles that make any form of practice too great an effort to be an easily established habit.

:::


### Chapter 11 - An Unconventional Education

To nurture a super-learner, its best to start early, find a specific subject, make it fun, and don't enforce it. Make it challenging with positive feedback. Make them develop their own passion for the subject and for self learning, for critical and creative thinking, for a mindset of growth and exploration.

:::note[An Unconventional Education]

- When you see yourself as lacking the potential to be good at something or believe that you’ll always be behind everyone else no matter how hard you work, it robs you of the motivation to work hard.
- An ultralearning-driven work environment might consist of employees’ spending a majority of their time on projects that are within or near their competency levels but devoting a specific fraction of their time to working on projects that are a leap above their current abilities.
- It is a profound error to claim that learning is about replacing ignorance with understanding. Knowledge expands, but so does ignorance, as with a greater understanding of a subject also comes a greater appreciation for all the questions that remain unanswered. In the face of this, one must simultaneously have confidence and deep humility.
- Finishing a project, therefore, isn’t usually accompanied by a sense of finishing learning but by the creation of a feeling of possibility as one’s eyes are opened to all the things left to learn.
