# The Myth of the Spoiled Child

## 🔗Connect
🔼Topic:: [Education (MOC)](/mocs/education-moc.md)


## ✒️ Note-Making

### 💡Clarify
🔈 *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Take a respective attitude** - Educate from a point of view of trying to help the children be the best self they can be. This means to work with them, not against them, to help them when they need to, but not crush their independence.
2. **Be mindful of exposing them to hardships** - Struggles don't necessarily build character, it is highly dependent on the difficulty and the context. unfortunately schools focus on competition which is the worse kind of challenge because it forces them to see the world as a zero-sum game, and pins them against each other. Also we lack support for "building them back up" after a failure, we focus on breaking them apart, without being there to pick up the pieces.
3. **Develop responsible children** - We don't want obedient children, these are mindless beings who we not fulfill their potential. We want to let them have a say, while also giving them responsibilities. To let them make mistakes but be there for them when they need us. To support their independence.

## 📒 Notes

### Introduction

There is almost no variance in the level of parental conservatism between people from different from different beliefs. We see education as an act of control for the betterment of the child, to make sure they don't grow up to be lazy and entitled. That they should have strict rules and experience failure.

This book comes to shatter some of those claims

:::note[Introduction]

- The sensible alternative to overparenting is not less parenting but better parenting. The alternative to permissiveness is not to be more controlling but more responsive. And the alternative to narcissism is not conformity but reflective rebelliousness. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=210))
- Permissive Parents, Coddled Kids, and Other Reliable Bogeymen ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=215))
- Each generation invokes the good old days, during which, we discover, people had been doing exactly the same thing. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=244))
- there is absolutely no evidence to support the claim that permissiveness is the dominant style of parenting in our culture, or even that it’s particularly common. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=430))
- there’s nothing unusual about today’s cohort of young people. “Every generation is Generation Me. That is, until they grow up.” ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=620))

### Permissive Parents, Coddled Kids and other Reliable Bogeymen

The claim that "today's generation is worse than what we were" has always been said, and has always been disproven. It is more a matter of perspective of "in my days..." than of actual change between generations.
Every generation is a "me me me generation" until they grow up

### Parenting in Perspective

**How we act towards our children is how they will eventually treat themselves and others**. If we are dictators, controlling, forceful and only care about compliance, than they will grow to be aggressive. However if we focus on building relationship, on being supportive, empathic, caring. Then that's what you'll get. You need to work "with" your child, not against them. [Synergy](/notes/win-win-situations.md)

:::note[Parenting in Perspective]

- Parenting at its core—or at least at its best—is a process of caring, supporting, listening, guiding, reconsidering, teaching, and negotiating. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=731))
- “Sometimes it’s easier to impose our will on kids, but we have to resist that temptation . . . and be the parent instead.” ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=743))
- “Working-with” parenting overlaps with what other writers have called “autonomy-supportive,” “responsive,” or “empathic” parenting. It’s quite different from a hands-off, disengaged style (permissiveness) as well as from an approach that emphasizes firm control, ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=813))

:::


### Overstating Overparenting

Control and permissiveness are fake opposites. It's not either or. Both seems to lack support for the child's needs, either because the parents needs comes first, or because they need to "figure things on their own."
**Healthy parenting is when we support children in their development and help them answer their needs without assuming what they need, or doing things for them**. We work with them, for them, acknowledging their autonomy while also bring supportive when they need us. [Respect](/notes/validation.md) [Micro-Management](/notes/micro-management.md)

:::note[Overstating Overparenting]

- People who felt they had to earn their parents’ love are likely to feel lousy about themselves. ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=1238))
- The appropriate response is not to do less for kids but to actively support their desire for having some say over their own lives (and also to meet their needs for empathy, guidance, and unconditional love). ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=1274))
- parents must walk a fine line, supporting self-sufficiency but also maintaining connection. That means responding to what one’s child needs rather than applying a simple, single-minded principle—“promote independence” ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=1422))
- The key variable that predicts whether parental support will prove beneficial isn’t how much of it is offered but whether that support is welcomed by the recipient or viewed as an imposition. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=1463))

### Getting Hit on the Head Lessons

Some say that it is essential for kids to go through [Hardship](/notes/struggle.md), specifically competitions in order for them to experience loss, struggles and to get back up on their own. These statements are problematic for a couple of reasons:

1. **Awards crowed out intrinsic motivation** - once the focus is getting a shiny reward instead of enjoying the process, we encourage children to develop [External Motivation](/notes/external-motivation.md) rather than [internal](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) one. To assume that one would not learn or work hard simply because they will not get an award at the end is to miss out the importance of intrinsic motivation entirely. [Crowding Out](/notes/crowding-out.md)
2. **Competitions bring out the worst of us** - not only that it's harmful to the losers to have such a hit to their self confidence, especially when the setting is meant to cause them harm, by making such a big deal of those who won. Some kids don't bounce back from repeated losses. But more importantly, it is also harmful for the winners. It might make them arrogant, and most likely that it will cause them to lose sight of other important things such as sleep and social relations only to win the prize. [Incentives](/notes/incentives.md) [Competition](/notes/competition.md)
3. **Awards are not correlated with success** - It is not always that the "best student wins", there is a combination of luck, and "playing the game", such as choosing the easy courses to get the best grades, or outside help from parents (aka play to win), etc. So what exactly are we rewarding here? [Goodhart’s Law](/notes/goodhart’s-law.md)

what about just making them used to experience hardship?
This is the "better get used to it" argument, which says that kids should be prepared to real life by experiencing hardships and failure. This is also problematic because:
1. **A self fulfilling prophecy** - teach kids that the world is a dog-eat-dog, where competition and using others is the only way to succeed creates such a world. A world of [Zero sum](/notes/binary-thinking.md) gains.
2. **What exactly are we promoting** - if the point is to teach children to "get back up" after failures, it doesn't seem that we really care about the second part. *We "hurt" children again and again, but we don't see signs of any system designed to help children learn how to get back up*, to use the support of their parents and friends, to find reasons to self motivate, and have a healthy perspective about failure and life, all of that is missing from the curriculum.
3. **a slippery slope** - just because life is hard later on, doesn't mean we should expose them to these kind of hardships so early, by that logic, why not have a tough teacher at kindergarten, or be a tough parent to a toddler? it is missing the point of adjusting to the child's needs. Children need to develop the capabilities in order to withstand those hardship, and it can be done if we are already "crushing" them so early in life

:::note[Getting Hit on the Head Lessons]

- Even if we thought it would be productive to subject kids to unpleasant experiences, neither rewards nor competition is productive, let alone necessary. ([Location 1675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=1675))
- From a developmental perspective, BGUTI is flat-out wrong. People don’t get better at coping with unhappiness because they were deliberately made unhappy when they were young. On the contrary, what best prepares children to deal with the challenges of the real world is to experience success and joy, to feel supported and respected, to receive loving guidance and unconditional care and the chance to have some say about what happens to them. ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=1792))
- what’s least likely to turn the experience of failure into something productive—are things like grades, contests, rewards, and punishments. ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=1912))

### Underlying Values

The education system is built around conservative, capitalistic values, mainly [Scarcity](/notes/scarcity.md) and competition. Nothing is free, everything has to be earned, and not everyone can succeed, so the success of one is necessarily at the expanse of another. Nothing should be interesting or enjoyable, because that's no how the real world is like. Everything should be hard and unpleasant. They should experience pain and failure. [learning should be hard](/notes/learning-should-be-hard.md)

These values are contradicting how good education should be, one that raises capable people.

### The Attack on Self Esteem

[Self Worth](/notes/self-worth.md) is crucial for success and wellbeing, but it should come from within, to be unconditional. Otherwise it would be unstable and volatile, ranging from narcissism to depression. To make it unconditional, **we should express [unconditional love](/notes/unconditional-love.md), to show them that their value is not based on their success** in school or any other external metrics, it is only because of our connection, and that will never change.

:::note[The Attack on Self-Esteem]

- one is free from depression “only when self-esteem is based on the authenticity of one’s own feelings and not on the possession of certain qualities.” ([Location 2581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=2581))
- Children don’t just need to be loved; they need to know that nothing they do will change the fact that they’re loved. ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=2609))

:::


### Why Self Discipline is Overrated

[Self Dicipline](/notes/self-control.md) is not always a good thing. For one, it could be a signal that we prefer to work hard rather than smart. We will stare temptation in the face instead of creating an environment where it doesn't exist. [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md)

High self disciplined people don't always know [When to Quit](/notes/when-to-quit.md). Their [Grit](/notes/grit.md) forces them to continue down the path of not letting go. They will save money but will never spend it on anything [exploration vs exploitation](/notes/exploration-vs-exploitation.md), they will give up on activities that they care about only because "duty calls" instead of standing up for themselves. They will miss good opportunities only because they have committed to what came first.

Instead we should focus on creating better environments where such self discipline that blames a child for "giving into their temptations", failing to reach a stoic standard, or to view his desires as something evil is no longer needed. To use the environment to our benefit by shaping the incentives and cues it creates.

Self discipline is promoted mainly to bring [obidience](/notes/obidience.md) rather than a tool for transcendence.

### Raising Rebels

Obedience is not want we want for our children, this creates narrow mindedness and hurts their independence. Instead we should encourage their independent thinking, giving them responsibilities and not force them into submission. We should let them become who they can be.

:::note[Raising Rebels]

- Encourage young people to focus on the needs and rights of others, to examine the practices and institutions that get in the way of making everyone’s lives better, to summon the courage to question what one is told and be willing to break the rules sometimes. ([Location 3369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=3369))
- There are three fundamental components of this more ambitious agenda. The first is to support kids’ inclination to care and develop a “prosocial” orientation. The second is to support their self-confidence and assertiveness. And the third is to help them embrace the value of skepticism and nonconformity. ([Location 3534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=3534))
- kids learn to make good decisions by making decisions, not by following directions. If we want them to take responsibility for making the world a better place, then we need to give them responsibilities. ([Location 3600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCHW4VF&location=3600))
