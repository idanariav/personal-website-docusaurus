## ✒️ Note-Making

### 💡Clarify
🔈 *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Find your essential intent** - To be able to detect and keep only the essential parts of your life, you have to first know what is the most essential thing for you. This is achieved through defining your "Essential Intent", which is a combination of goal + clarity, such as "I will become a doctor in five years".
2. **Select the vital few** - After having your essential intent, you can then compare each aspect of your life to it, and see if it is worth keeping. For example "Does this thing promotes me towards my essential intent"?
3. **Say no to the arbitrary many** - All of the aspects that fail to promote you towards your intent, you have to say no, gracefully, respectfully, but you have to set boundaries. These will hurt you in the short term, but grant you respect in the long run.
4. **Less is more** - Be the editor of your narrative, distill the essence from each action and habit. Try to do more with less, don't invest more resources, but rather free resources from unnecessary things
5. **Protect your wellbeing** - Remember that productivity is not the results of machines, but humans, that can burnout and be drained. Focus on yourself, on what recharges you, like sleep, nutrition and social life. Don't ignore those things or "do them later". They are not a waste of your time, but rather what provides you with the ability to be productive.

### 🗒️Relate

⛓ *Life lessons, action items*
1. **Define my essential intent** - I need to thing of the "one thing" that drives me, and work towards that. Perhaps philosophy, writing, educating, the combination of the three.

### 🔍Critique

✅ *by following this method, what will happen?*
1. You will have a more relaxed and enjoyable life since you will work only towards the essential aspects of it, and clear your mind and your resources from all other non-essential things.

❌ *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*

🧱 *Implementations and limitations of it are...*

### 🗨️Review

💭 *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
1. **Repetitive** - even the headlines are hard to distinguish from one another, and by the third part there is hardly anything new
2. **shallow** - while the idea is not too complicated, somehow it got stretched over many pages while not diving too deep to any specific point
3. **unbacked** - most of the scientific evidence is the form of "I met people" or "have this ever happen to you"

### 🖼️Outline

## 📒 Notes

### The Essentialist

Essentialism is to make the best use of our time, energy and motivation. That means we need to know "how to say no" [Saying no](/notes/saying-no.md), and to believe that "less is more" [Addition by subtraction](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md). When we narrow down our focus, we would be able to progress much more, but more critically, we would enjoy the process much more, and not just chase an endless destination while feeling stuck in place and stretched too thin.

Non essentialism is here because:
1. **Explosion of choices** - we have so much more to choose from, it is unavoidable that it will be harder for us to focus on just one thing [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md)
2. Social pressure - we are exposed more than ever to people's expectations on who we should be and what we should do [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md)
3. The "you could have it all" dream - everything is within our grasp, allegedly. But even if everything is possible, it doesn't mean that it's all possible all at once [the American dream](/notes/the-american-dream.md)

Life is like a messy closet. Only by going through it, dumping what's unnecessary and keep it organized we have a chance for a calm, focused life. [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md). What's more, it is a dynamic closet, people are filling it with the cloths they expect us to wear and messing it up.

The essentialist toolbox:
1. **Explore and evaluate** - for each part of your life, ask yourself is this the best thing for me?
2. **Eliminate** - find the courage to actually get rid of what's holding you back
3. **Execute** - have a habit of maintaining the order

:::note[The Essentialist]

- by being selective he bought himself space, and in that space he found creative freedom. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=132))
- Instead of making just a millimeter of progress in a million directions he began to generate tremendous momentum towards accomplishing the things that were truly vital. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=135))
- only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=143))
- Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=166))
- Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=179))
- The way of the Essentialist is the path to being in control of our own choices. It is a path to new levels of success and meaning. It is the path on which we enjoy the journey, not just the destination. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=220))
- If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=239))
- success can distract us from focusing on the essential things that produce success in the first place. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=275))
- It is not just the number of choices that has increased exponentially, it is also the strength and number of outside influences on our decisions that has increased. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=294))
- In the same way that our closets get cluttered as clothes we never wear accumulate, so do our lives get cluttered as well-intended commitments and activities we’ve said yes to pile up. Most of these efforts didn’t come with an expiration date. Unless we have a system for purging them, once adopted, they live on in perpetuity. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=328))
- it’s not enough to simply determine which activities and efforts don’t make the highest possible contribution; you still have to actively eliminate those that do not. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=342))
- once you’ve figured out which activities and efforts to keep—the ones that make your highest level of contribution—you need a system to make executing your intentions as effortless as possible. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=348))
- This is not a process you undertake once a year, once a month, or even once a week, like organizing your closet. It is a discipline you apply each and every time you are faced with a decision about whether to say yes or whether to politely decline. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=360))
- Essentialists systematically explore and evaluate a broad set of options before committing to any. Because they will commit and “go big” on one or two ideas or activities, they deliberately explore more options at first to ensure that they pick the right one later. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=385))
- “What do I feel deeply inspired by?” and “What am I particularly talented at?” and “What meets a significant need in the world?” ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=392))
- What if we stopped celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance? What if instead we celebrated how much time we had spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives? ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=433))

### ESSENCE What Is the Core Logic of an Essentialist?

The enemy of the essentialist (and it's conversion)
1. I have to -> I choose to
2. It's all important -> only a few really matters
3. I can do both -> I can do anything, but not everything

:::note[ESSENCE What Is the Core Logic of an Essentialist?]

- There are three deeply entrenched assumptions we must conquer to live the way of the Essentialist: “I have to,” “It’s all important,” and “I can do both.” Like mythological sirens, these assumptions are as dangerous as they are seductive. They draw us in and drown us in shallow waters. To embrace the essence of Essentialism requires we replace these false assumptions with three core truths: “I choose to,” “Only a few things really matter,” and “I can do anything but not everything.” ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=466))

:::


#### CHOOSE The Invincible Power of Choice

**We don't always have control on which options are available to us, but we are always free to choose among them**. [Freedom of response](/notes/agency.md)

To deny our ability to choose is to give others the power and permission to choose for ourselves.
Also, when we deny this ability, we become helpless. We either surrender to nothingness [lost in the infinite](/notes/lost-in-the-infinite.md), we simply give up and do nothing, or we become hyper and try to do everything, and say yes to everything.

:::note[CHOOSE The Invincible Power of Choice]

- while we may not always have control over our options, we always have control over how we choose among them. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=506))
- everything is designed to make it hard for us to say no. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=540))
- The Essentialist doesn’t just recognize the power of choice, he celebrates it. The Essentialist knows that when we surrender our right to choose, we give others not just the power but also the explicit permission to choose for us. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=558))

:::


#### DISCERN The Unimportance of Practically Everything

Effort is not directly linked to results, we can work harder with barely achieving anything, while also the opposite is true. [Struggle](/notes/struggle.md) **We can work smarter instead of harder and achieve a lot**. The way to do that is to **identify the vital few from the trivial many**, like the [Pareto Principle](/notes/pareto-principle.md), we should focus on the 20% opportunities that generates the most outcomes, and discard the rest. [triage](/notes/triage.md)

:::note[DISCERN The Unimportance of Practically Everything]

- Working hard is important. But more effort does not necessarily yield more results. “Less but better” does. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=591))
- an Essentialist takes the time to explore all his options. The extra investment is justified because some things are so much more important that they repay the effort invested in finding those things tenfold. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=635))

:::

#### TRADE-OFF Which Problem Do I Want?

[Multitasking doesnt exist](/notes/multitasking-doesnt-exist.md). We need to choose a strategy and stick to it [Pivot](/notes/pivot.md) [Hustle Culture](/notes/hustle-culture.md). **Only by truly dedicating ourselves into just one thing we can be truly successful** .

Life is about trade-offs, we can't do it all, and we must focus on the one thing that we truly want. **Saying yes to many things will hurt our progress in all of them**.

:::note[TRADE-OFF Which Problem Do I Want?]

- straddling means keeping your existing strategy intact while simultaneously also trying to adopt the strategy of a competitor. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=675))
- strategic position is not sustainable unless there are trade-offs with other positions.”3 By trying to operate by two incompatible strategies they started to undermine their ability to be competitive. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=683))
- saying yes to any opportunity by definition requires saying no to several others. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=694))
- By forcing us to weigh both options and strategically select the best one for us, we significantly increase our chance of achieving the outcome we want. ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=742))
- Trade-offs are not something to be ignored or decried. They are something to be embraced and made deliberately, strategically, and thoughtfully. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=773))

### EXPLORE Discern the Vital Few from the Trivial Many

To be able to discern the vital few from the trivial many, we need:
1. Space to think
2. Time to look and listen
3. Play
4. Sleep
5. Self Discipline

:::note[EXPLORE Discern the Vital Few from the Trivial Many]

- The way of the Essentialist, on the other hand, is to explore and evaluate a broad set of options before committing to any. ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=781))
- To discern what is truly essential we need space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep, and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make. ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=786))

#### ESCAPE The Perks of Being Unavailable

**The busier we are, the more we need time to reflect, to think and process**. To do that we have to limit [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md) [Minimalism](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md), use [Time Blocking](/notes/time-blocking.md) and create spaces where we can just stop and think. [Blank Space](/notes/blank-space.md) [Solitude](/notes/solitude.md). We need to give ourselves time and space to activate our [Downtime brain](/notes/downtime-brain.md).

:::note[ESCAPE The Perks of Being Unavailable]

- We need space to escape in order to discern the essential few from the trivial many. Unfortunately, in our time-starved era we don’t get that space by default—only by design. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=817))
- the faster and busier things get, the more we need to build thinking time into our schedule. And the noisier things get, the more we need to build quiet reflection spaces in which we can truly focus. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=885))
- LOOK See What Really Matters ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=923))
- It wasn’t enough to know the who, what, when, and where; you had to understand what it meant. And why it mattered.” ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=942))
- The best journalists do not simply relay information. Their value is in discovering what really matters to people. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=947))
- Discerning what is essential to explore requires us to be disciplined in how we scan and filter all the competing and conflicting facts, options, and opinions constantly vying for our attention. ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=967))

:::

#### Look

Many problems arise because we don't pay enough attention, not only to our thinking process, but mainly to the questions themselves, we don't notice the important details in our environment, such as patterns, or hints to complex situations.

One way is to keep a journal and review it from time to time, the other is to research New points of view. [Periodical Review](/notes/periodical-review.md)

#### PLAY Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child

**Play is essential to our lives**, it restores us to a [Beginner's Mind](/notes/beginners-mind.md), enjoying our surroundings and exploring new options [Gamification](/notes/gamification.md). It also helps to reduce stress.

:::note[PLAY Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child]

- Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement. And it’s the one thing that I believe we are systematically jeopardizing in the way we educate our children and ourselves.” ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1072))
- “Play,” he says, “leads to brain plasticity, adaptability, and creativity.” As he succinctly puts it, “Nothing fires up the brain like play.” ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1087))
- Play expands our minds in ways that allow us to explore: to germinate new ideas or see old ideas in a new light. It makes us more inquisitive, more attuned to novelty, more engaged. ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1107))
- Play stimulates the parts of the brain involved in both careful, logical reasoning and carefree, unbound exploration. ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1126))

:::


#### SLEEP Protect the Asset

**Against the stigma, sleep is not a waste of time, it is the necessary resource to bring us to the optimal state of peak efficiency**. Sleep is the source of our creativity, sharpness and focus. It is the [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md) factor of our waking hours. Eight hours is optimal, less than seven is not ideal.
We need to care for ourselves if we want to avoid burnout, and sleep is one of the most contributing factors. [Sleep](/notes/sleep.md)

:::note[SLEEP Protect the Asset]

- The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves. If we underinvest in ourselves, and by that I mean our minds, our bodies, and our spirits, we damage the very tool we need to make our highest contribution. ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1193))
- Essentialists instead see sleep as necessary for operating at high levels of contribution more of the time. ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1220))
- Sleep, the authors of the study concluded, allowed these top performers to regenerate so that they could practice with greater concentration. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1254))

:::


#### SELECT The Power of Extreme Criteria

**When we don't feel like "hell yeah" then we should say no**. It's better to let go of a good opportunity, to make room for the best one [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md) [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md) [Perfect is the enemy of good](/notes/perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good.md).
We should have an explicit, selective criteria to filter opportunities, and generally only consider the top 10%. If there's a doubt, it's a no.

:::note[SELECT The Power of Extreme Criteria]

- the very act of applying selective criteria forces you to choose which perfect option to wait for, rather than letting other people, or the universe, choose for you. ([Location 1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1350))
- Making our criteria both selective and explicit affords us a systematic tool for discerning what is essential and filtering out the things that are not. ([Location 1380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1380))
- First, write down the opportunity. Second, write down a list of three “minimum criteria” the options would need to “pass” in order to be considered. Third, write down a list of three ideal or “extreme criteria” the options would need to “pass” in order to be considered. By definition, if the opportunity doesn’t pass the first set of criteria, the answer is obviously no. But if it also doesn’t pass two of your three extreme criteria, the answer is still no. ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1435))

:::


### ELIMINATE How Can We Cut Out the Trivial Many?

We learned how to filter the best from the good, now it is time to learn how to let go of the non essential opportunities.

#### CLARIFY One Decision That Makes a Thousand

Without a clear goal, we have no [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md), and any step we do is only semi beneficial at best because we're not even sure if it's in the right direction. Furthermore, it can cause us to focus on the non essentials, specifically our image, favoring that over true essence of progress. [Life's Mission](/notes/lifes-mission.md)

What we need is a **essential intent**, which is both clear and inspirational.
The result of the clarity-inspiration matrix is:
Uninspiring:
1. Not clear - values (such as "innovation" and "justice").
2. Clear - okr (such as: will increase revenue by 5%)
Inspiring:
1. Unclear - mission statements (such as: will be the most innovative company in the us)
2. Clear - essential intent (I will become a doctor in the next five years)

The goal of the essential intent is to make a decision now that will filter our a thousand later on. **Each decision can be compared to our intent and ask "does is advance us towards our goal?" If not, discard it**. The essential intent must be phrased such that it could answer "how will we know when we have succeeded?"

:::note[CLARIFY One Decision That Makes a Thousand]

- When there is a serious lack of clarity about what the team stands for and what their goals and roles are, people experience confusion, stress, and frustration. When there is a high level of clarity, on the other hand, people thrive. ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1533))
- when we don’t have a clear sense of our goals, our aspirations, and our values—we make up our own social games. We waste time and energies on trying to look good in comparison to other people. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1545))
- Without clarity and purpose, pursuing something because it is good is not good enough to make a high level of contribution. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1561))
- Done right, an essential intent is one decision that settles one thousand later decisions. ([Location 1577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1577))
- An essential intent doesn’t have to be elegantly crafted; it’s the substance, not the style that counts. ([Location 1604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1604))

:::


#### DARE The Power of a Graceful “No”

**Saying no requires courage. Without it, we won't have the capacity to say yes to what we truly want.**
It's hard to say no, mostly due to social pressure and embarrassment, but remember that:
1. Saying no might cause short term damage, but you will gain respect for standing for your beliefs, and it's much better than a non-commited "yes"
2. You say no to the opportunity, not to the person. It doesn't have to damage the relationship
3. Remember your trade offs. It will give you the motivation to say no. In cases you are forced to say yes, ask which other thing you should deprioritize.
4. You can say no respectfully, while also saying yes to what you can commit to, or offer an alternative solution

:::note[DARE The Power of a Graceful “No”]

- Without courage, the disciplined pursuit of less is just lip service. ([Location 1660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1660))
- when we have strong internal clarity it is almost as if we have a force field protecting us from the nonessentials coming at us from all directions. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1691))
- The only way out of this trap is to learn to say no firmly, resolutely, and yet gracefully. Because once we do, we find, not only that our fears of disappointing or angering others were exaggerated, but that people actually respect us more. ([Location 1704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1704))
- the point is not to say no to all requests. The point is to say no to the nonessentials so we can say yes to the things that really matter. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1721))
- denying the request is not the same as denying the person. Only once we separate the decision from the relationship can we make a clear decision and then separately find the courage and compassion to communicate it.9 ([Location 1734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1734))
- Essentialists accept they cannot be popular with everyone all of the time. Yes, saying no respectfully, reasonably, and gracefully can come at a short-term social cost. But part of living the way of the Essentialist is realizing respect is far more valuable than popularity in the long run.

#### UNCOMMIT Win Big by Cutting Your Losses

The [Sunk Cost](/notes/sunk-cost.md) and [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md) can cause us to invest more time and energy into things we know are beyond saving. We need to admit our failures and move on, to act as if this is not part of our commitments and ask ourselves whether it is truly worthwhile to commit to it. Getting an outside view (either from an actual person or convert yourself to an external viewer)

:::note[UNCOMMIT Win Big by Cutting Your Losses]

- Sunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue to invest time, money, or energy into something we know is a losing proposition simply because we have already incurred, or sunk, a cost that cannot be recouped. But of course this can easily become a vicious cycle: the more we invest, the more determined we become to see it through and see our investment pay off.

- There should be no shame in admitting to a mistake; after all, we really are only admitting that we are now wiser than we once were. ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1912))
- Instead of trying to budget your time on the basis of existing commitments, assume that all bets are off. All previous commitments are gone. Then begin from scratch, asking which you would add today. ([Location 1943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1943))

#### EDIT The Invisible Art

Edit is the main essentialist craft, it is to both remove the unnecessary, and adjust the existing in such a way that we distill what we want to say/do in the most direct and concise way.

:::note[EDIT The Invisible Art]

- a good film editor makes it hard not to see what’s important because she eliminates everything but the elements that absolutely need to be there. ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1996))
- a good editor is someone who uses deliberate subtraction to actually add life to the ideas, ([Location 2008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2008))

#### LIMIT The Freedom of Setting Boundaries

Setting boundaries is a [win win situations](/notes/win-win-situations.md). **When people ask for your help and you always come to their rescue, you're both hurting the things you care about since you don't dedicate time for them**, and you rob of the other person's ability to solve their issues on their own. [Crowding Out](/notes/crowding-out.md)
**Setting [boundaries](/notes/boundaries.md) will actually increase your freedom to act without interference from others' agendas**.

:::note[LIMIT The Freedom of Setting Boundaries]

- It’s true that boundaries can come at a high price. However, not pushing back costs more: our ability to choose what is most essential in life. ([Location 2124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2124))
- when people make their problem our problem, we aren’t helping them; we’re enabling them. Once we take their problem for them, all we’re doing is taking away their ability to solve it. ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2156))
- you need to put up your fences well in advance, clearly demarcating what’s off limits so you can head off time wasters and boundary pushers at the pass. ([Location 2171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2171))
- when we don’t set clear boundaries in our lives we can end up imprisoned by the limits others have set for us. ([Location 2178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2178))

### EXECUTE How to Make Execution Effortless

#### BUFFER The Unfair Advantage

The world is full of [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md), and even on the best case we fail to predict how long it would actually take us to finish something [planning fallacy](/notes/planning-fallacy.md).
Therefore we need tools to help us protect ourselves from [Randomness](/notes/randomness.md) [Robustness](/notes/anti-fragility.md), specifically, **we need Buffers - extra time and resources that are reserved for emergencies** [Reserves](/notes/reserves.md). This could be 50% more time on your project, having a much earlier deadline, to have reserves of in case the main thing fails, broken, or lost.

:::note[BUFFER The Unfair Advantage]

- The only thing we can expect (with any great certainty) is the unexpected. Therefore, we can either wait for the moment and react to it or we can prepare. We can create a buffer. ([Location 2237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2237))
- projects and commitments tend to expand—despite our best efforts—to fill the amount of time allotted to them. ([Location 2253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2253))
- Essentialists accept the reality that we can never fully anticipate or prepare for every scenario or eventuality; the future is simply too unpredictable. Instead, they build in buffers to reduce the friction caused by the unexpected. ([Location 2367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2367))

#### SUBTRACT Bring Forth More by Removing Obstacles

**Locate the "slowest hiker", the obstacles that are preventing you from achieving your goal, and focus on removing them, rather than just adding more things around them** . The obstacle can be a lack of resource, another person, or your own perceptions. This is the [theory of constraints](/notes/theory-of-constraints.md), that your peak efficiency is limited by the weakest (slowest constraint), like a pipe, where the constraint is the most narrow part of it.

:::note[SUBTRACT Bring Forth More by Removing Obstacles]

- What is the obstacle that is keeping you back from achieving what really matters to you? By systematically identifying and removing this “constraint” you’ll be able to significantly reduce the friction keeping you from executing what is essential. ([Location 2400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2400))
- Instead of focusing on the efforts and resources we need to add, the Essentialist focuses on the constraints or obstacles we need to remove. ([Location 2431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2431))

#### PROGRESS The Power of Small Wins

We can either have huge goals and nothing to show for, or we can [Start Small](/notes/start-small.md), which would provide us with the [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md) to actually achieve those huge goals in the long run. It reinforces your motivation, and provides a positive feedback.

:::note[PROGRESS The Power of Small Wins]

- Essentialist starts small and celebrates progress. Instead of going for the big, flashy wins that don’t really matter, the Essentialist pursues small and simple wins in areas that are essential. ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2500))
- Each time a young person was recognized and commended for doing something good, he or she was that much more motivated to continue doing good until, eventually, doing good became natural and effortless. ([Location 2514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2514))

#### FLOW The Genius of Routine

Make an initial effort [Upfront costs](/notes/upfront-costs.md) to create positive habits. You can either change the behavior based on an existing [Cue](/notes/priming.md), or create new cues for better habits.
**Once you have good habits, good results will become effortless and automatic.**

:::note[FLOW The Genius of Routine]

- The Essentialist designs a routine that makes achieving what you have identified as essential the default position. ([Location 2639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2639))
- if we want to change our routine, we don’t really need to change the behavior. Rather, we need to find the cue that is triggering the nonessential activity or behavior and find a way to associate that same cue with something that is essential. ([Location 2710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2710))

#### FOCUS What’s Important Now?

We need to focus on the now, to find peace and balance. We can do it through [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md) practices and remembering the multitasking doesn't exist. **Ask yourself what is the most important thing now and focus on it.**

:::note[FOCUS What’s Important Now?]

- Multitasking itself is not the enemy of Essentialism; pretending we can “multifocus” is. ([Location 2840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2840))
- When faced with so many tasks and obligations that you can’t figure out which to tackle first, stop. Take a deep breath. Get present in the moment and ask yourself what is most important this very second—not ([Location 2858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2858))

#### BE The Essentialist Life

Essentialism is not just a practice, it's part of who you are. Little by little, the more you act like an essentialist, the more you become it, the easier it will be, and it will bring you joy, comfort, confidence, of life without regrets

:::note[BE The Essentialist Life]

- We can all live a life not just of simplicity but of high contribution and meaning. ([Location 2915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2915))
- The first is to think of it as something you do occasionally. The second is to think of it as something you are. ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2917))
- Every choice we make to pursue the essential and eliminate the nonessential builds on itself, making that choice more and more habitual until it becomes virtually second nature. ([Location 2947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2947))
- focusing on the essentials is a choice. It is your choice. That in itself is incredibly liberating. ([Location 2996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2996))
