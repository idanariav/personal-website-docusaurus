# Uptime (book)

## ‚úíÔ∏è Note-Making

### üîóConnect
üîºTopic:: [workflows (MOC)](/mocs/workflows-moc.md)

### üí°Clarify
üîà *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Combine time and energy management** - productivity is more than just clearing time for a task and following through, an important factor is to learn how to manage our energy, matching the task to the right time of day based on our energy level.
2. **Generate ideas through downtime** - the first part of productivity is about generating creative ideas. This requires downtime, time of relaxation, of experimentation and exploration, of detaching ourselves from technology and connecting with others or with nature
3. **Focus and execute top priorities** - the second part of productivity is about doing what needs to be done. This requires managing our time and energy, avoiding directions, limiting our commitments and finding ways to maximize our roi on time spent

### üóíÔ∏èRelate

‚õì *by following this method, what will happen? What is the goal of this book?*
1. More alignment between vision and action
2. Having a better balance between generating ideas following through with them, not just being a daydreamer, or a busy hustler without a goal.

### üîçCritique

‚úÖ *relevant research, metaphors or examples that helps to convey the argument*
1. **Uptime** - when computers run fully optimized on a specific task
2. t**asks loops** - productivity involves both opening loops, generating new creative ideas, and closing them, doing the necessary actions to bring them to life
3. **when-then** - to establish habits, we need to tie between a when (a triggering condition), and a then (the habit itself)
4. **Swiss cheese** - when something is too hard to do, we should do instead a shorter, more simpler version.
5. **Hot spots** - recognize where you are most productive and limit your work only to that place
6. **Zero based** - to start something from a clean slate, for example a zero based calendar is to imagine the perfect calendar, as if your week was completely at your control. 

‚ùå *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*

üß± *Implementations and limitations of it are...*
Some of the recommendations are more relevant for c-suite, entrepreneurs or high-tech workers, for example recommendations for calendar management.
### üó®Ô∏èReview

üí≠ *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
This book is very method based, focusing on the techniques for better productivity, but such techniques are common and repeated in various other books, videos or any free resources so this book is hardly innovative or inspiring.

Also, being a Google worker is nice but it is not the same has having credentials.

In Summary, it's a good starting book for the basics of productivity, but each of the ideas is presented better elsewhere.

## üìí Notes

### Introduction

Productivity is not just a matter of outputs, it's has to be related to the inputs, our goals and intentions, otherwise it will lead to [burnout](/notes/burnout.md). If we act according to our goals, then we are productive, no matter what those goals are, even if it's just watching TV. Productivity therefore is a A combination of *vision* and *execution*.

A feeling of "in the zone", when we do the right thing at the right time in a productive and energetic way is called *uptime*, which is the equivalent of a [flow](/notes/flow.md) experience. [motivational scheduling](/notes/motivational-scheduling.md)

The combination of vision and execution requires both the [Executive Attention Network](/notes/executive-attention-network.md) to bring visions to life, but also [rest](/notes/rest.md) and [downtime brain](/notes/downtime-brain.md) to generate new ideas.

This cycle is also called a *loop*, which has the following stages:
1. **Calm** - have an opportunity to relax and let the mind wander
2. **Create** - generate a new idea
3. **Capture** - make a note of it
4. **Consolidate** - plan your execution (when and how)
5. **Close** - follow through, do the action

We should resist the (Goes against:: [hustle culture](/notes/hustle-culture.md)) it's not about being busy, it's about focusing on what's important to you. Treat your time and energy as your bank account, don't just give it away to anyone who's asking. Think about the [Alternative cost](/notes/alternative-cost.md), what are you saying no to by saying yes to this.

To avoid over committing, ask yourself what would your future you want you to do right now? [zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md).

Time management is just the beginning, the true importance lies in energy management. A 30 minute block in your peak hours is not like 30 minutes in your afternoon slump. It's *flow + focus* which defines success.

### What to Do

#### Top Three Priorities

Ask yourself "what are the 3 top priorities in your life", since there is only 1 you, it means these priorities will include all the areas in your life. 3 is a good number both to remember, to focus on, and to avoid over committing yourself. Review these priorities quarterly.

Once you have your priorities, you need to break it down to clear, actionable tasks [clarity](/notes/clarity.md). Try having 3 tasks per priority. Additionally, it is recommended to use [Pre-Mortem](/notes/pre-mortem.md) to plan ahead and see which obstacles you might face and how will you deal with it. If you see yourself spending too much of your time on non-prioritized tasks, do a [post-mortem](/notes/post-mortem.md). Communicate these priorities to everyone around you so that you will be aligned, and use [Time Blocking](/notes/time-blocking.md) to make sure you allocate enough time for it.

To ensure you don't focus just on unplanned urgent things that keeps on popping up, use the [Eisenhower matrix](/notes/eisenhower-matrix.md), and try to separate the urgent from the important. If the same type of things come up as urgent, that is a sign of a failure in the system, and not something that should be fixed ad-hoc each time.

:::note[Top Three Priorities]

- It‚Äôs important to narrow your top priorities down to three because it reminds you that you have to put something down to pick another thing up‚Äîthere is always a trade-off. ([Location¬†226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C7W2KG3R&location=226))
- What will Future You be glad that you spent time on? What will Future You be glad that you turned down so you could be more focused on the right things? ([Location¬†272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C7W2KG3R&location=272))

#### How to Say no

Once we have our priorities, it is time to let go of as much as we can from all our other commitments, such that our priorities will take 70% of our time. We can either [Task sorting](/notes/task-sorting.md):
1. **Delete** - is this still relevant? What happens if I just don't do it? what is the worst case scenario? Is this worth my time considering all the other things I'm missing because of it
2. **Delegate** - can it be transferred to someone/something else? Can I automate it or pay someone to do this for me? Is it someone else's responsibility? Am I the right person for the job?
3. **Delay** - Must it be done now? Is there a better time to do it?

Remember to compare your tasks to your priorities, and try to cut back everything else. You can also try to do [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md), instead of stopping everything forever, try one week/month without doing these things and see how you and others react. Don't be afraid to say no, and don't feel obligated to offer something else in return unless it really works for you.

#### The List Funnel

To organize all our todos, we should use the list funnel:
1. Main list
2. Weekly list
3. Daily list
4. Hour by hour list

The main list includes everything, all our todos in a single place. The more we clear our heads, the easier it will be for us, knowing that the main list remembers everything for us. The tasks in the main list should be divided by [context](/notes/context.md), like things that can be done at home, work related, etc.

To make it concrete, we decide what should be worked on this week, this helps us bring our priorities into life. Be realistic about what you can accomplish this week considering your commitments and limitations.

Once we have everything at the weekly level, we create the daily list, marking what is the top priority for that day, and which tasks are considered "nice to have". The goal is to complete the top priority as soon as possible during the day. When diving the weekly tasks into dailies, it is best to consider a model of [task batching](/notes/task-batching.md), i.e to have a "daily theme" where we focus on certain types of tasks.

To make sure we have time for the daily tasks, we have to block time for it, which is where the hour by hour list comes in. Now, once we have run the process of converting tasks from an abstract idea to a week by week, day by day, hour by hour plan, it is much more likely we will be able to accomplish it.

:::note[The List Funnel]

- Lists are not a one-time thing‚Äîthey‚Äôre a living, breathing system that makes it easier for your brain to manage tasks and ensures that you execute them. They‚Äôre the backbone of productivity. ([Location¬†579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C7W2KG3R&location=579))

### When to Do it

#### Know Your Flow

Not all time slots are created equal. We all have hours when we are more productive than others, for example early birds best hours are in the morning, while it's the opposite for night owls. These are called *power hours* when we are at our peak and can (and should) do the most important work, when we can dive into ;[Deep Work (book)](/books/deep-work-book.md). We should plan our day accordingly such that the energy consuming tasks are at our power hours, and the rest are at our off peak hours.

#### Zero Based Calendaring

To avoid the [Ownership Bias](/notes/attachment.md), we need to think about our calendar from scratch, as if we had nothing on our schedule [clean slate](/notes/clean-slate.md). From there, we want to start blocking our power hours, the non negotiable, the daily themes, etc.

#### Time Review

While zero based calendaring is all about creating your ideal calendar, the time review is about going over your current calendar, checking:
1. how much are you in control of your schedule?
2. is one type of calendar spill into other types (like work into personal)?
3. how much time are you investing in different events?
4. which events are beneficial to you and which are not?
5. what can you change in the current calendar to make it more optimal?

#### Procrastination and how to Beat it

To tackle [procrastination](/notes/procrastination.md), we need to understand what causes it and which strategy we should deploy accordingly.
1. boring - make it fun [temptation bundling](/notes/temptation-bundling.md)
2. frustrating - research (how to do it better) or ask for help
3. difficult - [start small](/notes/start-small.md), or break down the task into smaller ones, like preparing gym cloths ahead of time
4. ambiguous - plan and clarify, set clear goals, methods and time in which you will preform it
5. lacking intrinsic reward - connect to your values, or find an [accountability](/notes/accountability.md) partner such that at least you will be motivated for them.

#### How Downtime Fuels Uptime

Our mind is either activating it's *focused mode* (the part that tries to close down loops), or the *downtime mode* that opens new loops by finding [Connections](/notes/coherentism.md) between existing ideas, and sparks [creative thinking](/notes/transferred-learning.md).

Having downtime improves the efficiency of the uptime.
That's why it's important to have downtime during our day, by taking breaks and [slowing down](/notes/slowing-down.md). Perhaps taking a [nature walk](/notes/nature-walk.md) without devices, taking some time alone, or even a vacation. It's best to have at least an hour a day.

### Where to Do it

#### Location Location Location

The covid crisis has made hybrid work much more common, and it is something hard to get used to because it means we need to be able to work comfortable in 2 different environments. First we need to identify where we work best. Is it the office with reduced distractions, or at home without people interrupting? Whichever you are, try to maximize your focus in that environment, for example brining noise canceling headphones to the office if you're a *homebaser*, or go to the library instead of staying home if you're an *outbaser*.

Try to coordinate your preferences with your team, for example making it clear when everybody's working from home, and try to have an "office day" with everyone. Also create regular social meetings to replace the ones that were lost due to hybrid.

#### Hot Spots and not Spots

Thinking is easier once we are consistent, especially when we tie it to a location. It a type of [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md) that gets our thinking rolling when we are used to perform it at certain locations. For example, if we only work at our office station at home, we will be much more focused there. These are our *hot spots*, where we tie a certain activity to a location. Having hot spots requires us also to have *not spots*, which means we separate activities into different locations without mixing, for example not only that my office space is where I work best, I intentionally don't work in any other location in the house. This helps reinforce the task-location connection, and helps put our mind into thinking mode more easily [habit formation](/notes/habit-formation.md).

### How to Do it well

#### The Balance of Boundaries

It's important to have clear and explicit [boundaries](/notes/boundaries.md), and to communicate them to others. Try to use a [positive language](/notes/positive-language.md) instead of a negative one, for example saying "I'm available between 2-5" instead of "don't book meetings after 5". This reduces the cognitive effort needed to interpret your boundaries, while also facilitating [cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md) because you signal that you wish to find a common ground.

#### A Plan to Plan

[planning](/notes/planning.md) is a very useful tool, and best used in advance. For example, plan your day the day before, which will allow you to start the day with clarity, instead of trying to plan on the go when we are already interrupted and have much less room to think and find a solution.
#### Make Meetings Meaningful

Meetings can have a negative roi, as they say "this could have been an email". To make sure meetings are as useful as possible:
1. **PAR** method:
	1. Purpose - what is the goal of this meeting? To brainstorm, to make a discussion, to share information or to connect socially?
	2. Agenda - what are the talking points?
	3. Results - what a successful meeting looks like?
2. **Short and small** - Have a small guest list as possible, only those who could contribute to the meeting, and make it as short as possible, even 15 minutes is sometimes enough. Try to avoid repeating meetings without checking what is the necessary cadence if any.
3. **Prepare** - Send relevant materials ahead of time
4. **Follow up** - If the meeting ended with a decision and an owner, check up that they are following through with that decision.

#### Turn Your Tools into Power Tools

Don't stick with the [Defaults](/notes/defaults.md) settings, [personalize](/notes/ownership.md) it, go over the settings, explore the features your tool offer, choose what is visible, how it is defined such that it matches your needs. Use keyboard shortcuts for increased efficiency.

#### Get ahead of Distractions

use [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md) in your favor. Avoid distractions by making them less likely in the first place, and increase [friction](/notes/friction.md) for getting distracted, like turning off your phone. Remember that [Multitasking doesnt exist](/notes/multitasking-doesnt-exist.md)
#### Mastering Email the Laundry Method

Email can be a black hole for productivity, sucking us in for hours on end. The problem is that the inbox serves as a mirror image of our memory capacity. The more emails in the inbox, the less free memory we have.

The solution is [Inbox Zero](/notes/inbox-zero.md). To use filters to delete or remove as many emails in advance from your inbox, and manually delete the rest. If you can create filters to highlight important emails (for example from your ceo) even better. Then, we sort through the remaining emails, dividing them into a *read*, *revisit* and *respond* piles. After taking the relevant action with an email, we archive it such that it won't appear in our inbox. That way we know exactly which emails remained unsolved and which we still need to go through.

### How to Live well while Doing it All

#### When-then Routines

To create strong and useful routines, we can use the *when-then* method. We think of when we want to trigger a habit, for example "every Tuesday when I finish dinner and sit at the desk", and combine it with the habit itself "then I would read a book for 10 minutes". This gives clarity and consistency, which is exactly what's needed for forming a habit.
#### No Tech Tuesday

We need to detox ourselves from the [FOMO](/notes/fomo.md) effects of technology and especially the [attention economy](/notes/attention-economy.md), we can do this by choosing one night a week where we don't use our phones between dinner and bedtime.

This freed up time is usually spent at being more with others, practicing a hobby, enjoying nature, or having a much needed rest.

To do a digital detox, try:
1. Putting your phone away in a different room
2. Delete hide or replace icon for social media apps
3. Use a currency method, where you have to earn screentime
4. Making a habit of not using the phone before bedtime and after wakeup

#### Mindful Mornings

Start your day a bit earlier and have 30 minutes for whatever you want. It is recommended to try [Meditation](/notes/meditation.md), because there's nothing more beneficial to our [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md) than meditation, it brings presence and clarity for the rest of the day. We start it with energy and positivity.

This time in the morning ensures you are more than just a worker or a caretaker, you are a person with depth, and you get to treat yourself with things that nourish you.

#### Achieving Uptime

Direction is more important than speed. Even implementing only some of the tips will already help you significantly in the long run [compounding](/notes/compounding.md)

:::note[Achieving Uptime]

- your aim, your course, your intention‚Äîis far more important than how fast you‚Äôre working, how much you‚Äôre getting done or churning out. ([Location¬†2710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C7W2KG3R&location=2710))
