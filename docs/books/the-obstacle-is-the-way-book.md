## ‚úíÔ∏è Note-Making

### üí°Clarify

üîà *Summary of main ideas*

Three pillars of stoic philosophy that will allow you not only to withstand obstacles, but rise above them.

1. **Perception** - We shift out attitude towards problems from one of escaping, frustration and helplessness to one of joy, as opportunity for growth. Also, let your reason guide you, instead of emotions. Avoid temptations and giving in to fear.
2. **Action** - Start, right now, give everything you got. Working hard doesn't mean working stupid. Analyze the situation, find the best method for victory, know that you will fail, learn from your mistakes, and remember that your strength is the your resilience, you can be patient, attentive, and rise when everyone else fades.
3. **Will** - Hope for the best, but expect for the worst. Accept that some things are beyond your control, and channel your energy and focus to the relevant places, which are your development and endurance. Love your fate, and be happy about everything that is happening, because every situation is an opportunity for growth or expression of virtues. Remember that you are always part of something bigger, whether other people or spirits, you are here to contribute, to shine as bright as possible before passing the torch onwards.

Amazing, it is very engaging, and I especially loved the part where he "answers back", like "you have to do this", and the reader responds "but I can't", and he answers "well, you need to x/y/z", it shows his humanity and his ability to read the crowd.
First and foremost, this is an inspirational book, from reading it you come out with power and motivation, like a fire burning within you to be better, to be greater, to withstand all hardships, to be a true stoic.

## üìí Notes

### Preface

:::note[PREFACE]

- The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. ([Location¬†97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=97))
- To act with ‚Äúa reverse clause,‚Äù so there is always a way out or another route to get to where you need to go. So that setbacks or problems are always expected and never permanent. Making certain that what impedes us can empower us. ([Location¬†99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=99))
- Whatever we face, we have a choice: Will we be blocked by obstacles, or will we advance through and over them? ([Location¬†119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=119))

:::


### Introduction

Obstacles are at every corner, and as we try and fail, we blame others, ourselves, we decay into [Anger](/notes/anger.md) and frustration.

But what if there's another way. **What if the obstacle itself has a unique lesson for us, that we can use obstacles to our benefit, to rise above them and be better for it** [Anti-Fragility](/notes/anti-fragility.md). We have to learn how to [fail](/notes/failure.md), and how to perceive it.

**In the best scenario, the obstacle will be the fuel to our fire, we would turn weakness into strength and motivation** [Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md) [Reverse Thinking](/notes/reverse-thinking.md)

Overcoming obstacles is one of the only way to grow [Adversarial Growth](/notes/creative-destruction.md), and nowadays we have too many ways to avoid obstacles, for our determent.

Overcoming obstacles requires:

1. **Perception** - Attitude towards problems
2. **Action** - Energy to resolve them and convert into opportunities
3. **Will** - Inner will against failures and difficulties

:::note[INTRODUCTION]

- There have been countless lessons (and books) about achieving success, but no one ever taught us how to overcome failure, how to think about obstacles, how to treat and triumph over them, and so we are stuck. ([Location¬†143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=143))
- Great individuals, like great companies, find a way to transform weakness into strength. ([Location¬†160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=160))
- It‚Äôs not just: How can I think this is not so bad? No, it is how to will yourself to see that this must be good‚Äîan opportunity to gain a new foothold, move forward, or go in a better direction. Not ‚Äúbe positive‚Äù but learn to be ceaselessly creative and opportunistic. ([Location¬†188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=188))
- Overcoming obstacles is a discipline of three critical steps. It begins with how we look at our specific problems, our attitude or approach; then the energy and creativity with which we actively break them down and turn them into opportunities; finally, the cultivation and maintenance of an inner will that allows us to handle defeat and difficulty. It‚Äôs three interdependent, interconnected, and fluidly contingent disciplines: Perception, Action, and the Will. ([Location¬†236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=236))
- obstacles are not only to be expected but embraced. ([Location¬†245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=245))

:::


### Perception

Once we clean our [Perception](/notes/subjective-reality.md) from biases and [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md), we are left with the truth, the ability to see things "in itself" [Objectivism](/notes/objectivism.md)

:::note[Perception]

- It takes skill and discipline to bat away the pests of bad perceptions, to separate reliable signals from deceptive ones, to filter out prejudice, expectation, and fear. But it‚Äôs worth it, for what‚Äôs left is truth. ([Location¬†253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=253))

:::


#### The Discipline of Perception

To have a good perception requires [Self-control](/notes/self-control.md), to resist both [Temptations](/notes/procrastination.md) and [Fear](/notes/fear.md) and maintain [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md) and let our reason guide us. Remember that we always have the [freedom of choice](/notes/agency.md).
This can help us stay away from dangers, and even turn them into an opportunity.

Our [System 1](/notes/system-1.md) brain is working against us, making us see threats and fears where non such exists, and surrender ourselves to emotions and [Impulsivity](/notes/impulsivity.md).

when faced with a challenge, try to:

1. be objective
2. control your emotions
3. see the good
4. to focus on the now
5. to notice when can be controlled

:::note[THE DISCIPLINE OF PERCEPTION]

- what matters most is not what these obstacles are but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure. ([Location¬†298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=298))
- Too often we react emotionally, get despondent, and lose our perspective. All that does is turn bad things into really bad things. ([Location¬†314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=314))
- We have a choice about how we respond to this situation (or any situation, for that matter). We can be blindly led by these primal feelings or we can understand them and learn to filter them. ([Location¬†319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=319))

:::


#### Recognize Your Power

**While you don't have complete control on outside circumstances [Acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md), you do and always have control over your thoughts, beliefs, and reactions to the situation**. This is your power that can't be taken away from you.
Moreover, you have the power to control the [Narratives](/notes/narratives.md) of what's happening to you. "good" or "bad" are concepts of judgment, not inherent properties of the situation [realism](/notes/realism.md).

:::note[RECOGNIZE YOUR POWER]

- through our perception of events, we are complicit in the creation‚Äîas well as the destruction‚Äîof every one of our obstacles. There is no good or bad without us, there is only perception. There is the event itself and the story we tell ourselves about what it means. ([Location¬†381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=381))

:::


#### Steady Your Nerves

Fear and [Stress](/notes/stress.md) will attack you without further notice, but **you have to steel yourself, maintain a cool head and not let those affect you.**

:::note[STEADY YOUR NERVES]

- Grace and poise are, because these two attributes precede the opportunity to deploy any other skill. ([Location¬†418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=418))

:::


#### Control Your Emotions

**We need to develop emotional resilience, we do so not by denying our emotions, but rather admit that in most cases, our emotions don't help us solve the problem,** they are just there. So we acknowledge them and move on, we let our reason guide us, and don't give in to stress and fear. With agency we reduce our fear of [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md), because we remember that **no matter what happens, we can always act virtuously**.

:::note[CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS]

- Obstacles make us emotional, but the only way we‚Äôll survive or overcome them is by keeping those emotions in check‚Äîif we can keep steady no matter what happens, no matter how much external events may fluctuate. ([Location¬†462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=462))
- If an emotion can‚Äôt change the condition or the situation you‚Äôre dealing with, it is likely an unhelpful emotion. Or, quite possibly, a destructive one. ([Location¬†474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=474))

:::


#### Practice Objectivity

We need to escape our subjective reality. When we focus on facts and remove interpretation, we gain [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md). The goal is to treat your problems as it was someone else's [Advice](/notes/advice.md). With [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md), we can focus on the core issue, without being mislead. Leave [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md) for later.

:::note[PRACTICE OBJECTIVITY]

- Having steadied ourselves and held back our emotions, we can see things as they really are. ([Location¬†516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=516))
- what happens when we give others advice? Their problems are crystal clear to us, the solutions obvious. Something that‚Äôs present when we deal with our own obstacles is always missing when we hear other people‚Äôs problems: the baggage. With other people we can be objective. ([Location¬†535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=535))

:::


#### Alter Your Perceptive

Perspective is everything, **by [Framing](/notes/framing.md) events differently we can change our emotional reaction to it, and more importantly, shape the type of action that will follow from it.**
We don't have to ignore our emotions, just find the best explanation for it. Additionally, it's best to remove ourselves from the obstacle's definition. For example, instead of "I hate public speaking", which leads us nowhere, only to escape this experience, we can convert it into "Public speaking demands preparation", which will cause us to prepare more, thereby decreasing our fear

:::note[ALTER YOUR PERSPECTIVE]

- when you can break apart something, or look at it from some new angle, it loses its power over you. ([Location¬†555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=555))
- The task, as Pericles showed, is not to ignore fear but to explain it away. Take what you‚Äôre afraid of‚Äîwhen fear strikes you‚Äîand break it apart. ([Location¬†560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=560))
- The way we look out at the world changes how we see these things. Is our perspective truly giving us perspective or is it what‚Äôs actually causing the problem? That‚Äôs the question. ([Location¬†573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=573))
- The difference between the right and the wrong perspective is everything. ([Location¬†593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=593))

:::


#### Is it up to You?

We have to separate what's within our control and what's not. W**e are in complete control over our thoughts, actions, emotions. We are not in control of other people, society, circumstances, etc.**
If we only dedicate our attention and energy to things that are within our control, we would experience success while avoiding a waste. We might even surprise ourselves with what we can achieve. So ask yourself: **do I have a chance? if so, give it your all.**

:::note[IS IT UP TO YOU?]

- what is up to us? Our emotions Our judgments Our creativity Our attitude Our perspective Our desires Our decisions Our determination This is our playing field, so to speak. Everything there is fair game. What is not up to us? Well, you know, everything else. The weather, the economy, circumstances, other people‚Äôs emotions or judgments, trends, disasters, et cetera. If ([Location¬†637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=637))
- Focusing exclusively on what is in our power magnifies and enhances our power. But every ounce of energy directed at things we can‚Äôt actually influence is wasted‚Äîself-indulgent ([Location¬†654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=654))

:::


#### Living in the Present Moment

Don't focus on the interpretation of events, on reasons and abstract concepts or day dreaming. **Focus on the now**, on the pleasantness of life, on the problem at hand. Dedicate all your attention to it, to live your present moment fully. [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md)

:::note[LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT]

- Focus on the moment, not the monsters that may or may not be up ahead. ([Location¬†687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=687))

:::


#### Think Differently

If we believe we can't do something, we would truly won't be able to, but the reverse is also true. **By believing we can achieve above and beyond what we thought was possible, we have a much better chance to succeed** [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md)

:::note[THINK DIFFERENTLY]

- Our perceptions determine, to an incredibly large degree, what we are and are not capable of. In many ways, they determine reality itself. When we believe in the obstacle more than in the goal, which will inevitably triumph? ([Location¬†725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=725))

:::


#### Finding the Opportunity

Once we have avoided the negative aspects of the obstacle, it's time to flip our thinking and find it's advantages. An obstacle is neither just a blessing or a curse [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md), it's more complicated. **Any obstacle is an opportunity for us to become better, to try new things** [Limits](/notes/limits.md), **it is through this conflict that we get better, the struggle is essential.**
This is not an issue of "glass half full", this is a ~100% flipping of our thinking to see the opportunity within. Only then we can be truly anti-fragile to obstacles.

:::note[FINDING THE OPPORTUNITY]

- after you have controlled your emotions, and you can see objectively and stand steadily, the next step becomes possible: a mental flip, so you‚Äôre looking not at the obstacle but at the opportunity within it. ([Location¬†784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=784))
- Blessings and burdens are not mutually exclusive. It‚Äôs a lot more complicated. ([Location¬†810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=810))
- The extent of the struggle determines the extent of the growth. The obstacle is an advantage, not adversity. The enemy is any perception that prevents us from seeing this. ([Location¬†818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=818))
- No one is talking glass-half-full-style platitudes here. This must be a complete flip. Seeing through the negative, past its underside, and into its corollary: the positive. ([Location¬†837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=837))

:::


#### Prepare to Act

With a clear head, we now have the obligation to act, to put our focused and prepared mind into good use

:::note[PREPARE TO ACT]

- It‚Äôs a huge step forward to realize that the worst thing to happen is never the event, but the event and losing your head. ([Location¬†843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=843))
- A clearer head makes for steadier hands. And then those hands must be put to work. Good use. ([Location¬†846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=846))

:::


### Action

**The right action is a deliberate, courageous, persistent one.**

:::note[Action]

- Action requires courage, not brashness‚Äîcreative application and not brute force. Our movements and decisions define us: We must be sure to act with deliberation, boldness, and persistence. ([Location¬†858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=858))

:::


#### The Discipline of Action

**The only way to solve an obstacle is through. No one can save you, or replace you. It is your obstacle to bare, to bring your entirety to, to become a spearhead of action that will turn the obstacle into growth.**
We have got to act, there is no other option, no other choice. [obligation to act](/notes/obligation-to-act.md)

:::note[THE DISCIPLINE OF ACTION]

- In life, it doesn‚Äôt matter what happens to you or where you came from. It matters what you do with what happens and what you‚Äôve been given. ([Location¬†910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=910))
- each obstacle we overcome makes us stronger for the next one. ([Location¬†922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=922))
- No one is coming to save you. And if we‚Äôd like to go where we claim we want to go‚Äîto accomplish what we claim are our goals‚Äîthere is only one way. And that‚Äôs to meet our problems with the right action. ([Location¬†926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=926))

:::


#### Get Moving

**Start, right now, no excuses, with all your might**. By starting, we gain [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md), and when we pour ourselves into it the momentum grows and becomes unstoppable. [Start Small](/notes/start-small.md)

:::note[GET MOVING]

- They start. Anywhere. Anyhow. They don‚Äôt care if the conditions are perfect or if they‚Äôre being slighted. Because they know that once they get started, if they can just get some momentum, they can make it work. ([Location¬†945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=945))
- those who attack problems and life with the most initiative and energy usually win. ([Location¬†980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=980))
- If you haven‚Äôt even tried yet, then of course you will still be in the exact same place. ([Location¬†990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=990))
- If you want momentum, you‚Äôll have to create it yourself, right now, by getting up and getting started. ([Location¬†995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=995))

:::


#### Practice Persistence

**Once you've started, don't stop. You will not be stopped**. You will persist [Grit](/notes/grit.md) and resist all distractions and temptations that are trying to lead you astry, and you will not quit [When to Quit](/notes/when-to-quit.md).
Since you aren't going anywhere, don't feel rushed, have confidence in the fact that you progress each day, and one day you will succeed.

:::note[PRACTICE PERSISTENCE]

- We will not be stopped by failure, we will not be rushed or distracted by external noise. We will chisel and peg away at the obstacle until it is gone. Resistance is futile. ([Location¬†1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1013))
- The thing standing in your way isn‚Äôt going anywhere. You‚Äôre not going to outthink it or outcreate it with some world-changing epiphany. ([Location¬†1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1033))
- Once you start attacking an obstacle, quitting is not an option. ([Location¬†1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1044))
- Persist in your efforts. Resist giving in to distraction, discouragement, or disorder. ([Location¬†1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1050))
- It‚Äôs supposed to be hard. Your first attempts aren‚Äôt going to work. It‚Äôs going to take a lot out of you‚Äîbut energy is an asset we can always find more of. ([Location¬†1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1062))

:::


#### Iterate

Success and failure are intertwined. Failure is a necessary step for learning, it provides valuable [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md). every time we feel, we need to adapt and start again [First Batch Trash](/notes/first-batch-trash.md) [practice beats perfection](/notes/practice-beats-perfection.md)

:::note[ITERATE]

- Failure really can be an asset if what you‚Äôre trying to do is improve, learn, or do something new. It‚Äôs the preceding feature of nearly all successes. There‚Äôs nothing shameful about being wrong, about changing course. ([Location¬†1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1075))
- Action and failure are two sides of the same coin. One doesn‚Äôt come without the other. ([Location¬†1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1086))
- It‚Äôs time you understand that the world is telling you something with each and every failure and action. It‚Äôs feedback‚Äîgiving you precise instructions on how to improve, it‚Äôs trying to wake you up from your cluelessness. It‚Äôs trying to teach you something. Listen. ([Location¬†1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1119))

:::


#### Follow the Process

Focus on the next action you need to do right now, break down your goals into bite sized chunks [Chunking](/notes/chunking.md), and trust that your everyday actions will breed the results you are looking after[Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md).

:::note[FOLLOW THE PROCESS]

- When it comes to our actions, disorder and distraction are death. The unordered mind loses track of what‚Äôs in front of it‚Äîwhat matters‚Äîand gets distracted by thoughts of the future. The process is order, it keeps our perceptions in check and our actions in sync. ([Location¬†1160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1160))
- The process is about doing the right things, right now. Not worrying about what might happen later, or the results, or the whole picture. ([Location¬†1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1193))

:::


#### Do Your Job, Do it Right

No matter which job or task is bestowed upon us, no matter if someone is watching or not, no matter our preferences and social status. **It is our duty to do our best, to be [honest](/notes/honesty.md), and to help others we encounter on our path.** [Integrity](/notes/integrity.md)

:::note[DO YOUR JOB, DO IT RIGHT]

- Wherever we are, whatever we‚Äôre doing and wherever we are going, we owe it to ourselves, to our art, to the world to do it well. That‚Äôs our primary duty. And our obligation. When action is our priority, vanity falls away. ([Location¬†1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1217))
- Each and every task requires our best. ([Location¬†1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1229))
- all we need to do is those three little duties‚Äîto try hard, to be honest, and to help others and ourselves. ([Location¬†1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1245))

:::


#### What's Right is what Works

Be pragmatist, be "flexible". Don't go for [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md), **go for progress, for what works. be able to think outside the box and be as assertive and bold as you need to be**

:::note[WHAT‚ÄôS RIGHT IS WHAT WORKS]

- Pragmatism is not so much realism as flexibility. There are a lot of ways to get from point A to point B. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a straight line. It‚Äôs just got to get you where you need to go. ([Location¬†1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1293))
- do the best with what you‚Äôve got. ([Location¬†1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1298))
- Start thinking like a radical pragmatist: still ambitious, aggressive, and rooted in ideals, but also imminently practical and guided by the possible. Not on everything you would like to have, not on changing the world right at this moment, but ambitious enough to get everything you need. Don‚Äôt think small, but make the distinction between the critical and the extra. Think progress, not perfection. ([Location¬†1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1301))

:::


#### In Praise of the Flank Attack

Know your strengths and weaknesses, and your opponent's too. Don't face them head on in their most powerful position. **Find the way around, create opportunities that are best suited for your situation**. [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md). Usually the smaller player is more flexible and adaptable [scalability](/notes/scalability.md) [Adaptability](/notes/adaptability.md), which could be a great advantage against a more rich/strong opponent.

:::note[IN PRAISE OF THE FLANK ATTACK]

- Take a step back, then go around the problem. Find some leverage. Approach from what is called the ‚Äúline of least expectation.‚Äù ([Location¬†1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1337))
- Being outnumbered, coming from behind, being low on funds, these don‚Äôt have to be disadvantages. They can be gifts. Assets that make us less likely to commit suicide with a head-to-head attack. These things force us to be creative, to find workarounds, to sublimate the ego and do anything to win besides challenging our enemies where they are strongest. ([Location¬†1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1351))

#### Use Obstacles against Themselves

Some obstacles will destroy themselves, perhaps their own force is self destructive, and accordingly our best action is to let them fall, be passive, continue our path without tackling them at all. **Be [patient](/notes/patience.md) and attentive to know when to wait and for how long**

:::note[USE OBSTACLES AGAINST THEMSELVES]

- You can use the actions of others against themselves instead of acting yourself. ([Location¬†1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1382))
- we also have to be ready to see that restraint might be the best action for us to take. ([Location¬†1409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1409))
- In fact, the best way to get what we want might be to reexamine those desires in the first place. Or it might be to aim for something else entirely, and use the impediment as an opportunity to explore a new direction. ([Location¬†1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1417))

:::


#### Channel Your Energy

**We need to channel our energy from negative to positive. From anger to fuel, from anxiety to readiness**. We need to be physically loose, meaning that we don't freeze in the moment of action, but we are still mentally strict, in control, so that we don't just act restlessly, but we do the right action. A sense of "flow", a power that runs quiet and deep, like water.

:::note[CHANNEL YOUR ENERGY]

- Instead of giving in to frustration, we can put it to good use. It can power our actions, which, unlike our disposition, become stronger and better when loose and bold. ([Location¬†1460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1460))
- To be physically and mentally loose takes no talent. That‚Äôs just recklessness. (We want right action, not action period.) To be physically and mentally tight? That‚Äôs called anxiety. It doesn‚Äôt work, either. Eventually we snap. But physical looseness combined with mental restraint? That is powerful. ([Location¬†1474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1474))

:::


#### Seize the Initiative

**it is actually in the moments of crisis that we can shine**, when people lest expect it of us, we don't shy, don't cower in fear or have mercy on ourselves, we act, we seize the initiative and turn crisis into victory.

:::note[SEIZE THE OFFENSIVE]

- It‚Äôs at the seemingly bad moments, when people least expect it, that we can act swiftly and unexpectedly to pull off a big victory. While others are arrested by discouragement, we are not. We see the moment differently, and act accordingly. ([Location¬†1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1498))
- this crisis in front of you? You‚Äôre wasting it feeling sorry for yourself, feeling tired or disappointed. You forget: Life speeds on the bold and favors the brave. ([Location¬†1513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1513))

:::


#### Prepare for None of it to Work

**Sometimes despite our bests efforts we will fail. We have to learn to accept it and move on**. To use chances of failures to practice our virtues, to keep our head held high, to be kind and helping others in times of difficulty, and **never stop trying**.

:::note[PREPARE FOR NONE OF IT TO WORK]

- We might perceive things well, then act rightly, and fail anyway. Run it through your head like this: Nothing can ever prevent us from trying. Ever. ([Location¬†1541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1541))
- We have it within us to be the type of people who try to get things done, try with everything we‚Äôve got and, whatever verdict comes in, are ready to accept it instantly and move on to whatever is next. ([Location¬†1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1555))

### Will

:::note[Will]

- We must prepare for adversity and turmoil, we must learn the art of acquiescence and practice cheerfulness even in dark times. ([Location¬†1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1563))

:::


#### The Discipline of Will

Will is the one thing we are truly in control 100% of the time. Since this is only about our internal world, about keeping it together, maintaining our cool head and our resilience to external factors. **As long as we are strong, unshakeable, enduring, we will outlive any evil, any obstacle.**

:::note[THE DISCIPLINE OF THE WILL]

- If Perception and Action were the disciplines of the mind and the body, then Will is the discipline of the heart and the soul. The will is the one thing we control completely, always. ([Location¬†1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1611))
- Will is fortitude and wisdom‚Äînot just about specific obstacles but about life itself and where the obstacles we are facing fit within it. It gives us ultimate strength. As in: the strength to endure, contextualize, and derive meaning from the obstacles we cannot simply overcome ([Location¬†1614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1614))

:::


#### Build Your Inner Citadel

**No one is born strong or resilient, it takes practice**. [Practice beats talent](/notes/practice-beats-talent.md) Instead of treating your weaknesses as a given, you can work on yourself to remove those. To **train your mind and body to be better**, to overcome obstacles, to be ready for a rainy day where stress pressure and pain are coming at you. Sure, you hope such a day won't come, but you need to be ready non the less. [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md)

:::note[BUILD YOUR INNER CITADEL]

- Not everyone accepts their bad start in life. They remake their bodies and their lives with activities and exercise. They prepare themselves for the hard road. Do they hope they never have to walk it? Sure. But they are prepared for it in any case. Are you? Nobody is born with a steel backbone. We have to forge that ourselves. ([Location¬†1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1672))
- the Inner Citadel, that fortress inside of us that no external adversity can ever break down. An important caveat is that we are not born with such a structure; it must be built and actively reinforced. ([Location¬†1689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1689))
- The path of least resistance is a terrible teacher. We can‚Äôt afford to shy away from the things that intimidate us. We don‚Äôt need to take our weaknesses for granted. ([Location¬†1703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1703))

:::


#### Anticipation

Do a [Pre-Mortem](/notes/pre-mortem.md). B**y thinking about the worst possible outcomes, we can be ready in advance**. Then, when something fails, and eventually something will do, we will be ready for it. We will not feel disappointed, surprised or discouraged, because we foresaw these obstacles in advance. **We expected to face the worst, so our body and mind is ready**. While expecting that everything will go smoothly is a recipe for pain and even harder struggles because we weren't ready [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md)

:::note[ANTICIPATION (THINKING NEGATIVELY)]

- Always prepared for disruption, always working that disruption into our plans. ([Location¬†1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1736))
- It‚Äôs better to meditate on what could happen, to probe for weaknesses in our plans, so those inevitable failures can be correctly perceived, appropriately addressed, or simply endured. ([Location¬†1756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1756))
- the person who has rehearsed in their mind what could go wrong will not be caught by surprise. The person ready to be disappointed won‚Äôt be. They will have the strength to bear it. ([Location¬†1767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1767))

:::


#### The Art of Acquiescence

There are things outside of our control that we must learn to accept. **Accept doesn't mean to give us, on the contrary, it means channeling our energies not towards self resentment or the world, but rather towards our development**. Limits can be a powerful resource for growth. It requires us to think outside of the box, to find new ways of doing what others are doing unconsciously, and that means we will learn to do it better, we will understand it more, and we will overcome.

It means to appreciate what we have [Gratitude](/notes/gratitude.md) and use it to the fullest. Accept that some things are not up to us, and they just happen, like Murphy's law or "god willing"

:::note[THE ART OF ACQUIESCENCE]

- constraints in life are a good thing. Especially if we can accept them and let them direct us. They push us to places and to develop skills that we‚Äôd otherwise never have pursued. ([Location¬†1788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1788))
- We have to allow some accidents to happen to us. ([Location¬†1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1792))
- When the cause of our problem lies outside of us, we are better for accepting it and moving on. ([Location¬†1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1805))
- It‚Äôs time to be humble and flexible enough to acknowledge the same in our own lives. That there is always someone or something that could change the plan. And that person is not ([Location¬†1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1835))

:::


#### Love Everything that Happens

**Since we have no control over some of the things that happens to us, especially the bad ones, what response would be better than to be happy for it? None**. Happiness gives us strength and motivation to move on, and if there's no reason for suffering, why inflict it on ourselves? The answer is to always [Amor Fati](/notes/amor-fati.md)

:::note[LOVE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS: AMOR FATI]

- We‚Äôve got to love what we do and all that it entails, good and bad. We have to learn to find joy in every single thing that happens. ([Location¬†1865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1865))
- We don‚Äôt get to choose what happens to us, but we can always choose how we feel about it. And why on earth would you choose to feel anything but good? We can choose to render a good account of ourselves. If the event must occur, Amor fati (a love of fate) is the response. ([Location¬†1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1907))

:::


#### Perseverance

**Endurance of our will is the strongest ability we can have**. To endure all hardship and carry on, to be stopped only by death. If people today are raised with silver spoons, they will have no endurance, they will fall with the first sign of hardship. But we, the people of obstacles, we would endure.

:::note[PERSEVERANCE]

- Life is not about one obstacle, but many. What‚Äôs required of us is not some shortsighted focus on a single facet of a problem, but simply a determination that we will get to where we need to go, somehow, someway, and nothing will stop us. ([Location¬†1940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1940))
- The good thing about true perseverance is that it can‚Äôt be stopped by anything besides death. ([Location¬†1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1970))

:::


#### Something Bigger than Yourself

When we stop thinking about ourselves, when we focus on others, on how we can help make the world a better place, we not only diminish the difficulties we face, we also find new strength to carry on. **Shared goals give us purpose**. [Human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md)

:::note[SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF]

- when we focus on others, on helping them or simply providing a good example, our own personal fears and troubles will diminish. With fear or heartache no longer our primary concern, we don‚Äôt have time for it. Shared purpose gives us strength. ([Location¬†2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=2021))
- We‚Äôre going to be of service to others. Help ourselves by helping them. Becoming better because of it, drawing purpose from it. ([Location¬†2038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=2038))

:::


#### Meditate on Your Mortality

**[Death](/notes/death.md) is the greatest obstacle we face, and there is little we can do about it. Therefore it shouldn't be a source of depression or denial, but rather acceptance and motivation**. When everything is finite, it's easier to prioritize, to check whether our actions match our preferences or when we will be on our deathbeds, will we have regret? Make every second count, because we have a finite number of those. [memento mori](/notes/memento-mori.md)

:::note[MEDITATE ON YOUR MORTALITY]

- Death doesn‚Äôt make life pointless, but rather purposeful. ([Location¬†2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=2068))
- thinking about and being aware of our mortality creates real perspective and urgency. It doesn‚Äôt need to be depressing. Because it‚Äôs invigorating. ([Location¬†2096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=2096))

:::


#### Prepare to Start Again

**Life is a series of never ending obstacles, and the more we overcome, the harder it will get. But knowing that, we can behave accordingly**, we can remember that there will always be more obstacles, so we need to conserve our energy, that each one is a stepping stone to the next, and that we wouldn't have wanted it to be different, because in a world without obstacles, we don't grow. So have no fear, be eager for the next challenge.

:::note[PREPARE TO START AGAIN]

- Life is a process of breaking through these impediments‚Äîa series of fortified lines that we must break through. Each time, you‚Äôll learn something. Each time, you‚Äôll develop strength, wisdom, and perspective. Each time, a little more of the competition falls away. Until all that is left is you: the best version of you. ([Location¬†2117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=2117))
- Knowing that life is a marathon and not a sprint is important. Conserve your energy. Understand that each battle is only one of many and that you can use it to make the next one easier. More important, you must keep them all in real perspective. ([Location¬†2123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=2123))

### Final Thoughts

:::note[FINAL THOUGHTS The Obstacle Becomes the Way]

- The essence of philosophy is action‚Äîin ([Location¬†2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=2247))
- Philosophy was never what happened in the classroom. It was a set of lessons from the battlefield of life. ([Location¬†2253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=2253))
