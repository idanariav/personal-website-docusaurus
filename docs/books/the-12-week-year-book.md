# The 12 Week Year (book)

## 🔗Connect
🔼Topic:: [Productivity (Map)](/mocs/productivity-map.md)


## ✒️ Note-Making

### 💡Clarify
🔈 *Summary of main ideas*
1. **shorter is better** - a shorter timeframe is better since it uses the "deadline" effect to boost our motivation, higher certainty than yearly planning, and less options to get distracted or procrastinate
2. **harmonic resonance** - a weekly plan is much easier to implement than a monthly/quarterly/yearly plan since we are used to visualize work, goals, and actions on a weekly basis, so it fits well with our schedule.
3. **We lack in action, not information** - since the digital age has begun, we are no longer lacking in information. We know exactly what we need to do, what is the best course of action, and we simply lack the framework that would enable us to implement this knowledge into action.

### 🗒️Relate

⛓ *by following this method, what will happen? What is the goal of this book?*
1. **More productive** - the entire goal of the book is to help you produce better plans, and narrow down your focus into 12 week segments which will help you achieve your goals
### 🔍Critique

✅ *relevant research, metaphors or examples that helps to convey the argument*
1. **use a 12 week plan** - use the 12 week framework to boost your productivity, start from a vision, write a plan for 12 weeks, break it down to weekly measurements, and review weekly your progress.
2. **time blocking** - have strategic blocks for deep work, buffer blocks for regular maintenance, and rest blocks for leisure and energizing.
3. **support systems** - motivation and action are easier when we include others in our life. By having accountability sessions, they can help us keep us on track.
4. **Lead and Lag indicators** - To properly track your progress, have both lead (input) indicators, such as time spent, and lag (output) indicators, such as deals won.
5. **Weekly accountability meetings** - follow your progress with other peers that would make you accountable.

❌ *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*

🧱 *Implementations and limitations of it are...*

### 🗨️Review

💭 *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
1. The split between the "things you know", and "putting it together" is a waste. It is very repetitive, with the minor difference of adding a section to write it when you want to start your 12 week plan.

### 🖼️Outline

## 📒 Notes

### Part 1 - Things You Think You Know

#### Chapter 1 - The Challenge

**Today our main barrier to having the life we want, to be who we want to be, is not a knowledge problem, it is an execution problem**. Like dieting, most of us know that we should workout and eat mostly vegetables, but it is the "doing" that is lacking. [Insight Gap](/notes/akrasia.md)

:::note[Quotes]

- Knowledge is only powerful if you use it, if you act on it. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=245))
- Execution is the single greatest market differentiator. Great companies and successful individuals execute better than their competition. The barrier standing between you and the life you are capable of living is a lack of consistent execution. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=248))
- increase your current results, lower your stress, build your confidence, and feel better about yourself. Not by working harder, but by focusing on the activities that matter most, maintaining a sense of urgency to get those things done, and shedding the low-value activity that keeps you stuck. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=297))

:::


#### Chapter 2 - Redefining the Year

**Annual planning is more harmful than good**. It creates [procrastination](/notes/procrastination.md) at the beginning, because we "have a lot of time left", and we make up for it at the end.

The "end" of the year is an arbitrary deadline [Deadline Effect](/notes/deadline-effect.md) that pushes us towards action. Therefore, **why not create a shorter timeframe, where the deadline is close enough to generate the sense of urgency right from the start**, and avoid procrastination, but far enough to have time to produce meaningful results?

:::note[Quotes]

- annual goals and plans are often a barrier to high performance. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=317))
- We mistakenly believe that there is a lot of time left in the year, and we act accordingly. We lack a sense of urgency, not realizing that every week is important, every day is important, every moment is important. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=331))
- The end of the year represents a line in the sand, a point at which we measure our success or failure. Never mind that it’s an arbitrary deadline; everyone buys into it. It is the deadline that creates the urgency. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=369))
- Periodization began as an athletic training technique designed to dramatically improve performance. Its principles are focus, concentration, and overload on a specific skill or discipline. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=384))
- The great thing about having a 12 Week Year is that the deadline is always near enough that you never lose sight of it. It provides a time horizon that is long enough to get things done, yet short enough to create a sense of urgency and a bias for action. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=423))

:::


#### Chapter 3 - the Emotional Connection

**Action doesn't come without motivation, and motivation stems from having a vision**. [change starts from the inside out](/notes/change-starts-from-the-inside-out.md). Without it, it will be much harder to stick to actions that are annoying or painful in the short term, for the benefits in the long term. [Present Bias](/notes/present-bias.md)

Having a vision has an additional benefit, due to [Neuroplasticity](/notes/neuroplasticity.md), thinking about fulfilling our potential, about growth, can cause our brain to change such that actions related to growth are seem more positive, with more internal motivation to do them, and less stress. **Thinking about change allows us to want it.** [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md)

:::note[Quotes]

- When faced with a course of action that includes difficult or uncomfortable tasks, the short-term costs of taking action can seem so much greater than the long-term benefits of reaching the goal. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=450))
- The secret to living your life to its potential is to value the important stuff above your own comfort. Therefore, the critical first step to executing well is creating and maintaining a compelling vision of the future that you want even more than you desire your own short-term comfort, and then aligning your shorter term goals and plans, with that long-term vision. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=456))
- Vision is the starting point of all high performance. You create things twice; first mentally, then physically. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=469))
- This capacity for our brains to change is called neuroplasticity. Here’s why it’s such a big deal: Your brain has the ability to change and develop physiologically, and it does so based on how you use it. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=522))

:::


#### Chapter 4 - Throw out the Annual Plan

In general, plans are great, they:
1. **reduce mistakes** - which are identified while planning
2. **saves time** - you think of better ways to reach your goals
3. **gives focus** - knowing what to do if half the battle

and the 12 week year is an even more powerful plan since it is in a shorter deadline than a yearly plan, which increases predictability. That means that your plan can be more concrete, and more likely to succeed. [Life's Mission](/notes/lifes-mission.md)

:::note[Quotes]

- Working from a plan has three distinct benefits: 1. It reduces mistakes. 2. It saves time. 3. It provides focus. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=542))
- With a 12 week plan, predictability is much greater. You can define, with a high degree of certainty, what actions you need to implement ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=563))
- With the 12 Week Year, the approach is to be great at a few things instead of mediocre at many things. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=570))
- Effective planning strikes a working balance between too much complexity and too little detail. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=579))

:::

#### Chapter 5 - One Week at a time

**The best way to make progress is focusing on your actions**, results will be the by product of that, so don't focus on them. [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md)
Review your weekly plan once a week, and your daily plan at the start of the day to stay focused. [Periodical Review](/notes/periodical-review.md).

:::note[Quotes]

- Long-term results are created by the actions you take every day. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=601))
- you have greater control over your actions than you do your results. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=604))

:::


#### Chapter 6 - Confronting the Truth

**To only way to know if you are sticking to your plan is to do score keeping**, both of lag (results) indicators, and lead (inputs) indicators.

These indicators can give a useful feedback on the usefulness of our plan and outcomes. The key is consistency, not perfection. Sometimes we will fail to reach our weekly goal, but we should use that as motivation to improve the week after. [Goodhart’s Law](/notes/goodhart’s-law.md)

:::note[Quotes]

- scorekeeping lets us know if what we’re doing is effective. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=659))
- Scorekeeping functions as a reality check, providing performance feedback and insight into your effectiveness. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=667))
- An effective measurement system will have a combination of complementary lead and lag indicators. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=683))
- As a general rule, you should rarely change the plan unless you’ve been effectively completing your plan tactics and it is still not producing. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=703))
- Instead of responding to the discomfort by bailing out, high achievers use the tension as an impetus to move forward. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=733))

:::


#### Chapter 7 - Intentionality
Controlling our time and focus are essential to reaching our goals.
The best way to do that is with [Time Blocking](/notes/time-blocking.md).
Have three separate blocks during your week:
1. **Strategic blocks** - aka deep work sessions, where we act according to plan
2. **buffer blocks** - sessions to deal with unexpected tasks such as chores and emails
3. **rest blocks** - in order not to burnout, we also need time to recharge

:::note[Quotes]

- if you are not purposeful about how you spend your time, then you leave your results to chance. ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=751))
- Living with clear intention goes against the powerful natural tendency to be reactive because it requires you to organize your life around your priorities and consciously choose those activities that align with your goals and vision. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=758))
- There are three primary components of performance time: strategic blocks, buffer blocks, and breakout blocks. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=777))

:::


#### Chapter 8 - Accountability as Ownership

[Accountability](/notes/accountability.md) is not an external entity that forces responsibility on your results. **It's you taking responsibility for your actions. It's look at everything in life as a choice, not as an external obligation**. This gives us freedom and power to act, not just do the bare minimum. [Agency](/notes/agency.md).

:::note[Quotes]

- Accountability is not consequences, but ownership. It is a character trait, a life stance, a willingness to own your actions and results regardless of the circumstances. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=828))
- Everything we do in life is a choice. Even in an environment where there are requirements of you, you still have choice, but there is a big difference when you approach something as a choose-to versus a have-to. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=839))
- When you understand that true accountability is about choice and taking ownership of your choices, everything changes. You move from resistance to empowerment, from limits to possibilities, and from mediocrity to greatness. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=856))

:::


#### Chapter 9 - Interest Vs Commitment

Being "interested" is a low stakes, low effort situation. It is an unstable situation where results are not likely to show up.
However, **to be committed is to promise yourself, to bind yourself**. It requires a strong drive, a sacrifice of time and resources, and doing even when you don't feel like it. (Goes against motivational scheduling)

:::note[Quotes]

- A commitment is a personal promise. Keeping your promises to others builds trust and strong relationships, and keeping promises to yourself builds character, esteem, and success. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=885))

:::


#### Chapter 10 - Greatness in the Moment

Results are an indication of your success, not the success itself.
**True success are your habits, your commitment, dedication, grit, to do what's necessary** [Grit](/notes/grit.md)

:::note[Quotes]

- Our attention is spread over various subjects and conversations, and when we strive to do so much, we actually apply very little of ourselves to any individual activity. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=939))
- Results are not the attainment of greatness, but simply confirmation of it. You become great long before the results show it. It happens in an instant, the moment you choose to do the things you need to do to be great. ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=970))
- Intentional Imbalance ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=989))
- Life balance is achieved when you are purposeful about how and where you spend your time, energy, and effort. At different times in your life you will choose to focus on one area over another, and that’s perfectly fine, ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1003))

:::

#### Chapter 11 - Intentional Imbalance

Life is not a perfect balance between all areas of life. Try and be intentional with your time, focusing each time at a different section of life.

### Part 2 - Putting it All together

#### Chapter 12 - The Execution System

The 12 week year will be your operating system, meant to facilitate and incorporate all the other systems in your life, to activate them. [Medium Independent](/notes/medium-independent.md)
In order for it to succeed, you need three principles: commitment, accountability and consistency,
But also 5 components: vision, plan, alignment tools, measurements, and time management

:::note[Quotes]

- A few days or weeks of that is no big deal, but when you put together day after day after day—week after week after week—the result is like compound interest, ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1052))
- Commitment and accountability go hand-in-glove. In a sense, commitment is accountability projected into the future. It is ownership of a future action or result. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1076))
- These three principles—accountability, commitment, and greatness in the moment—form the foundation of personal and professional success. ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1083))

:::


#### Chapter 13 - Establish Your Vision

Vision is the source of our motivation, the root of your plan, and the main thing that will keep you going on the difficult days.
**Dream big, start from the utopian long term future, and narrow it down to a three year vision**. Include all your different rules in life. A strong vision is one that incorporates both personal and professional life.
Share it with others, keep your vision fresh in your mind, review your progress daily vs the vision.

:::note[Quotes]

- the potential of vision to create the emotional energy needed to inspire positive action even in an environment of charred earth. ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1224))
- The most powerful visions address and align your personal aspirations with your professional dreams. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1227))
- The first step, then, to reaching your biggest dreams is to shift from impossible thinking to possible thinking. ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1244))

:::

#### Chapter 14 - Develop Your 12 Week Plan

A good plan can save you time, keep you focused, and improve the changes of reaching the goal.
The advance of the 12 week year is that it is short enough so you can create a clear and detailed plan with relatively small uncertainty, compared to an annual plan.

When planning, focus on these aspects:
1. **alignment** - Be aligned with your vision
2. **brainstorm** - all possible tactics to reach that goal
3. **less is more** - have only a few goals, and choose the minimal number of steps needed to reach it
4. **keep it simple**
5. **action driven** - each tactic should be detailed, easy to measure whether you had accomplished it or not, and start with a verb, like "do/call/write"...

:::note[Quotes]

- An effective plan takes time to create, and it requires some hard work. It may seem counterintuitive, but by taking time to plan up front, the overall time and effort to complete a task can be significantly reduced. ([Location 1376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1376))
- It is difficult in the moment to know what your highest value activities are because you are typically not choosing between good activity and bad activity; you are choosing between higher value and lower value activity and that ranking often isn’t clear in the moment. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1401))
- Don’t overanalyze the content of your plan. Don’t be concerned that your plan isn’t perfect—there are no perfect plans. Once you have a good plan, your execution of the tactics will help you to learn what works best so you can refine your plan from there. ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1516))
- You will need to say no to some things in order to be great at the things that matter most. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1613))
- As with your goals, the general rule is less is more. If you can accomplish the goal with four tactics, then you don’t need five. Brainstorm all the tactics you can, and then select the critical few. ([Location 1622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1622))

:::

#### Chapter 15 - Installing Process Control

Process control are tools that reduce your need for will power when sticking to the plan, and increase chances of consistency.

There are two main components:
1. **Weekly plan** - based on the 12 week plan, create a weekly plan that takes the necessary tactics and deadlines for that week. Best to plan it at the beginning of the week, and review it each day
2. **Wam** - weekly accountability meetings. Peers are a great tool for motivation. In these meetings, each one will say what his plan is, how well did he preform, and receive support and compliments from his peers. [peer support](/notes/peer-support.md)

:::note[Quotes]

- Without structural and environmental support, follow through becomes a constant exercise of willpower. ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1642))
- Process control uses tools and events to create support structures that can augment, and in some cases take the place of, willpower. ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1645))
- “There is no such thing as a self-made man. You will reach your goals only with the help of others.” ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1677))

:::


#### Chapter 16 - Keeping Score

**Without measurement there can be no progress and no improvements**.
Use lag and lead indicators, preferably more frequent ones. For example, a quarterly indicator
leaves no flexibility and it is hard to learn from it.
Don't be afraid to give yourself a bad score, and a bad score doesn't mean you should stop your plan.
Be honest, learn from your indicators what you should improve, and remember that actions are more important than results.

:::note[Quotes]

- Measurement drives the execution process. It is your touchstone with reality. ([Location 1809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1809))
- In general, the more frequent a measure is, the more useful it is. ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1840))
- Without measurement there is no way for you to know what adjustments would be productive. ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1889))

:::


#### Chapter 17 - Take back Control of Your Day

Focus on your priorities first, don't assume that you can "do it all". If you stick to "urgent" first, you will never get to the important things.

have 3 blocks:
1. **Strategic**: a weekly, 3-hour block to deal with deep work and advance towards your goal
2. **buffer**: once or twice a day for 30 minutes, where you deal with the "common" tasks, such as emails, phones, chores, etc...
3. **break**: a weekly 3-hour break for rest to avoid [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md), focus on satisfying leisure, not numbing ones

Don't fall for distractions, use your calendar, your plan, and your vision to stay focused.

:::note[Quotes]

- most often keeps you from being exceptional is not a lack of time, but the way you allocate the time that you have. ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=1951))
- Some of your choices may make it seem like you are staying busy when in reality you are choosing to avoid your more important, and often more difficult activity. ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2005))
- To be your best, you must intentionally align your time and activities with your strengths and your unique capabilities. ([Location 2029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2029))
- Strategic blocks are three hours in length and should be scheduled early in your week so that if one gets interrupted or cancelled, you have time to reschedule it. They are blocks of time when you work on your business, not in it. Strategic blocks should also be scheduled during times when your work activity is typically lowest. One strategic block per week is usually adequate. ([Location 2047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2047))
- Buffer blocks are designed to deal with the lower-level activity and are typically between 30 minutes and one hour in length, scheduled one to two times per day. ([Location 2050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2050))
- Breakout blocks are designed to prevent burnout and create more free time. They are three hours in length, and should be scheduled once a week ([Location 2053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2053))
- If you frequently defer the strategic work to accomplish the urgent, lower-value activities, you will never accomplish great things. ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2129))

:::

#### Chapter 18 - Taking Ownership

**Instead of making excuses, of blaming everybody else, embrace your mistakes, learn from them, and do better next time**.
Accountability is never about the results, but rather the process. Is to stop being a victim and take control of your life, to continue to learn, to advance, to imagine a better future.
Understand what is in your realm of influence, and work constantly to expand it, while improving everything within it.

:::note[Quotes]

- people with a victim mind-set pay a terrific price. A victim allows his success to be limited by external circumstances, people, or events. As long as we continue to be victims of our circumstances, we will experience life as a struggle and others as a threat. ([Location 2204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2204))
- Accountability is not concerned with fault, but rather what it takes to create better results. ([Location 2210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2210))
- When we acknowledge our accountability, our focus shifts from defending our actions to learning from them. ([Location 2214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2214))
- Taking ownership means that you stop looking outside yourself. Stop letting all those things keep you from living the life you desire, the life you are capable of. ([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CU9P31K&location=2259))

:::


#### Chapter 19 - 12 Week Commitment

Commitment is a promise, that if broken it breaks trust in yourself, and your relationships with others. It might be better to say no (never commit) than to commit only to break your promise.
Therefore, once you have committed, you should be all in. Have an account ability buddy, and try to connect your commitment to a deep drive, that will keep you motivated in difficult times.
