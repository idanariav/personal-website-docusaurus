# Atomic Habits (book)

## ‚úíÔ∏è Note-Making

### üîóConnect
üîºTopic:: [Habits (MOC)](/mocs/habits-moc.md)

### üí°Clarify
üîà *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Compounding is the strongest force we can muster** - The most life changing thing we can do is to create systems that use compounding for our benefit. We use time and inter connectivity in our favor, turning small steps into huge wins.
2. **Focus on identity, not goals** - Goals are not a good tool for motivation, there are limited and technical. However, when we focus on the person we want to become, it is easier to make the change happen, we internalize it, we become it, and it sustains itself. Similarly, we should focus on the systems that represent and support that identity. Usually this means to shape your environment in your favor, rather than relying on willpower.
3. **Habits are learned, automated solutions to problems** - habits are neither good or bad, they serve as a learned, automated response to problems we have faced in the past. It is a connection between a cue, the craving it generates, and the action it promotes.
4. **maximize your habits** - To make good habits easier to implement, and bad habits harder to perform, follow these four rules (do the reverse for bad habits):
	1. make them obvious - have the cue as visible as possible, for example if you want to eat healthy, put vegetables at the most accessible and visible place in your fridge
	2. make them attractive - do habit stacking, combine the good habit with an activity you like to do, like watching tv while doing exercise
	3. make them easy - remove friction, and start small
	4. make them satisfying - reward yourself by completing the habit, use a habit track to follow your progress
5. **Compounding is hidden, demoralizing, takes patience** - Change, and success as a by-product, is a process that takes time. Focus only on the next step. What seems like a small, irrelevant step now will provide huge benefits in the future. Focus on the now, and the results will come.

### üóíÔ∏èRelate

‚õì *by following this method, what will happen? What is the goal of this book?*
1. we would be system oriented instead of goal oriented, which is much more stable and useful in the long run for implementing change in a consistent way
2. we would use the power of compounding in our favor, leading to significant improvements in our lives
3. we would maintain good habits while stopping bad ones.

### üîçCritique

‚úÖ *relevant research, metaphors or examples that helps to convey the argument*
1. The "point-and-say" method to add mindfulness to daily actions to reduce errors
2. Implementation intention - I will do x at time y in location z. It is stronger with habit stacking, when you try to chain habits together

‚ùå *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*
The later section about the importance of genes in picking the right habits sounds too much like a fixed mindset, as if we are highly limited by our genes. While it might be true physically for sports and such, it is hardly the case for other (and most common) types of activities.

üß± *Implementations and limitations of it are...*

### üó®Ô∏èReview

üí≠ *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
How he opens his book with his personal stories is still one of the best openings I've read, even after ~200 books. It shows humility, persistence, grit and growth. He has achieved much, yet not clouded by power.

### üñºÔ∏èOutline

![Atomic Habits (book).webp](/books/atomic-habits-book.webp)

## üìí Notes

### Introduction

It's all about [compounding](/notes/compounding.md), even from the worst of situations, you can rise to the greatest heights.

Success takes time [trust the process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), nobody succeeds overnight. It takes [consistency](/notes/consistency.md), which is built on even the [smallest](/notes/start-small.md) of actions

:::note[Introduction My Story]

- A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly‚Äîand, in many cases, automatically.
- I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started.
- changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you‚Äôre willing to stick with them for years.
- the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.
- while Skinner‚Äôs model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states‚Äîour moods and emotions‚Äîmatter, too.

### The Fundamentals - why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

#### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

Although compounding has such a strong effect, it's drawbacks are that it's far away in the future. The benefits are not [tangible](/notes/clarity.md), so we don't consider these small acts as important, focusing either on huge one offs or simply falling to [temptations](/notes/temptations.md) because "what's the difference".

Habits are a two sided sword. The good ones will improve you drastically, while the bad ones will hurt you drastically on the long run. A 1% daily improvement is 37x in a year. Similarly a 1% drop is 37x weaker by the end of the year.

To know where your habits are taking you, it takes [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md). To recognize where you can improve, it requires [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md) to see what little changes you can do to improve in the long run. Don't accept the [defaults](/notes/defaults.md). Each area of your life, as little as can be, can be beneficial or harmful to you. You must find out which is which [Quantifiable self](/notes/quantifiable-self.md).

Compounding is not only across time, but across areas as well. For example, if you improve 1% over many different sub tasks, your overall productivity will improve much more than just 1%. [optimization](/notes/optimization.md), even by just a bit has huge effects. It can serve as a [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md) in many areas.

At some point, the compounding effect becomes tangible once it crosses a [Critical mass](/notes/critical-mass.md), like a bamboo tree that spends years developing its roots, and suddenly bursts into the skies in just a short period of time. Progress is [non linear](/notes/non-linear.md), and "overnight successes" are just the compounding outburst of years of preparation. [Mastery](/notes/mastery.md) requires [Patience](/notes/patience.md).

Although the *plateau of latent potential* is unsatisfying, remember that all the effort you do is [stored](/notes/effort-storing.md).

We should all focus on systems (aka habits) rather than goals. The compass is more important than the destination. The problems with goals are:
1. **Prone to survivors bias** - winners and losers had the same goals. It's not the goal that gets you to the finish line, it's the systems. [Survivors Bias](/notes/survivors-bias.md).
2. **It's temporary** - like cleaning up a messy room, you'll have to do it again tomorrow. It's better to set it up such that it won't get messy in the first place, rather than working every time to clean it. It's a matter of [GIGO](/notes/garbage-in-garbage-out.md). If we fix our inputs (aka the systems), the outputs will take care of themselves.
3. **They're counter to happiness** - goals create a feeling of [Future disillusionment](/notes/future-disillusionment.md), of "I'll be happy when", instead of focusing on the way you live right now. They lead to a [Zero sum](/notes/binary-thinking.md) thinking, either we achieved it and we're successful, or failed to achieve it and we're miserable.
4. **They leave you empty** - you achieved the goal, now what? You feel drained, empty, without motivation and nothing to do

Atomic habits are small steps that are part of a larger system for self improvement, they have a compounding effect.

:::note[The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits]

- It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.
- if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you‚Äôll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you‚Äôre done.
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.
- when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day,
- our small choices compound into toxic results.
- Success is the product of daily habits‚Äînot once-in-a-lifetime transformations.
- You get what you repeat.
- If you want to predict where you‚Äôll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
- habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.
- in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau‚Äîwhat I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.
- Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored.
- The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it‚Äôs the work you did long ago‚Äîwhen it seemed that you weren‚Äôt making any progress‚Äîthat makes the jump today possible.
- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
- Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.
- Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
- True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It‚Äôs not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

:::

#### How Your Habits Shape Your Identity

There are two reasons why good habits don't stick and bad ones do:
1. We change in the wrong direction
2. We try the wrong way

Most of us try to change by focusing on the outcomes - "I want to lose five pounds", "I want to quit smoking". This however doesn't stick because outcomes are the outermost circle of our behavior. The inner circles are processes (like habits) and identity (the center of the circle). A good change [starts from the inside](/notes/change-starts-from-the-inside-out.md), by focusing on our identity - "I am not a smoker", "I am a healthy person".

Striving for a new identity is the best way to generate [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md), we do these habits not because we want an external outcome, rather it is an alignment to who we believe ourselves to be.

However, embracing a new identity requires [Forgetting](/notes/forgetfulness.md) or [Rewriting](/notes/rewriting.md) our existing identity.

Our identity isn't born out of nothing, it is the result of our actions. We are [being by doing](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md). By taking the actions that our desires identity would do, we become that identity. When we write, we are embodying a writer, when we play, we become a musician.

All is true for bad habits and identities as well. When we practice [Self Criticism](/notes/self-criticism.md), we embrace negative identities that limit us.

:::note[How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)]

- Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.
- It‚Äôs hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven‚Äôt changed who you are.
- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It‚Äôs one thing to say I‚Äôm the type of person who wants this. It‚Äôs something very different to say I‚Äôm the type of person who is this.
- You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you‚Äôll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.
- Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.
- Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
- Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.
- The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior.
- the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.
- We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.
- Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.
- Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
- Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWho is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?‚Äù
- Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It‚Äôs a two-way street.
- your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be.

### How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

Habits are the result of successful experimentation in the past. At first we try things at random, but once we found out something that works, we "save" this behavior for future cases to make our decision making easier and less costly [Human Brain](/notes/human-brain.md) [reinforced learning](/notes/reinforced-learning.md).

This requires us to get [feedback](/notes/feedback.md) for our environment. If we don't know if something works, we won't turn it into a habit.

Habits are what allows us to thrive because it reduces the amount of [Decision points](/notes/decision-points.md) we have throughout the day, leaving more energy available for other choices

This means that habits are the best solution to a problem, we do them because they are affective at achieving an outcome. Which problem and which outcome that's what determines whether they are "good" or "bad"

Following [The habit loop](/notes/the-habit-loop.md), we recognize two main component
1. **The problem phase** - the cue we face and the craving it triggers within us
2. **The solution phase** - the action we take in response to the craving, and the following reward it gives

:::note[How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps]

- Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.
- a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution.
- It‚Äôs only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.
- cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.
- Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit.
- The response is the actual habit you perform,
- Rewards are the end goal of every habit.
- If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit.
- How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying?

:::

### Make it Obvious

#### The Man Who Didn't Look Right

The first step is to actually notice the cues, instead of letting them affect us without us noticing. It requires [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md) and [Focus](/notes/focus.md), to truly pay attention to our environment.

Vocalizing our actions, like - "I'm about to eat this cookie despite it being unhealthy" or "tomorrow I'm going to wake up at seven to workout "adds [Visibility](/notes/visibility.md), self awareness, and even have a coercive power due to [Cognitive Alignment](/notes/cognitive-alignment.md), because it's harder for us to "betray" what we already physically said we will do/avoid doing.

Awareness is the first step.

:::note[The Man Who Didn‚Äôt Look Right]

- you don‚Äôt need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful.
- If a habit remains mindless, you can‚Äôt expect to improve it.
- There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems.

:::


#### The Best way to Start a New Habit

Habits are easier to start and maintain once we have a [plan](/notes/planning.md) that brings clarity. Replace "I will exercise more" with "I will do ten pushups every day at seven in my kitchen". This is called *implementation intention*, and it makes it more likely that we will follow through. Using *habit stacking*, we can chain habits together, turning one habit as the cue for the next one. For example, "after I do ten pushups, I will meditate for five minutes "

:::note[The Best Way to Start a New Habit]

- people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.
- The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.
- Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.
- the secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.

:::


#### Motivation is Overrated, Environment Often Matters More

We are highly affected by our environment, that is why a [Nudge](/notes/nudge.md) can have huge effects on our habits.

Our environment is more than a collection of objects, these are cues and contexts that trigger a craving within us. Seeing cookies makes us hungry, seeing the TV distracts us. That's why it's best to fill our environment with positive cues and reduce negative ones.

Vision is the strongest sense for detecting cues.

It is best to have one habit per cue. For example, only do work in your office room, and watch tv in the living room. If you mix (watch tv in your office), it's likely that the bad, easy habits will win. Make it clear for your body which behavior corresponds with which location. It's easy to have a [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md) and create new habits in a new environment, but you can also shape your existing one. Reduce [Ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md) by assigning a role to each location

:::note[Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More]

- Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.
- visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.
- For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.
- When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.
- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.
- you can alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones.
- Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.
- Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you.
- It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.
- Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you‚Äôll start mixing habits‚Äîand the easier ones will usually win out.
- A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.

:::


#### The Secret to Self Control

The key to [Self-control](/notes/self-control.md) is not to need it in the first place. It is better to shape your environment once so that you would not have to face situations that require self control

This is especially true when we recall that habits can be overcome, but not forgotten. So the best way to reduce bad habits is to get rid of the cues that trigger them. It's better and easier to avoid temptations than to resist them [Willpower is Limited](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md)

:::note[The Secret to Self-Control]

- ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control.
- So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it‚Äôs unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time.
- Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.

:::


### Make it Attractive

#### Good to Make a Habit Irresistible

What makes us take action is dopamine which controls the reward center of the brain. It leads to the craving, the motivation that pushes us to act. Without it we will be [indifferent](/notes/indifference.md).

At first, it's the reward itself that spikes our dopamine, but once a habit sets in, it's the craving that triggers it, while the reward itself does nothing. It's the [anticipation](/notes/expectations.md)of reward that brings the most joy.

That it why [Temptation Bundling](/notes/temptation-bundling.md) is so strong. By connecting a habit we need to do, with a habit we want to do, the craving will give us the motivation to do the second while wishing for the latter.

:::note[How to Make a Habit Irresistible]

- The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.
- dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.
- Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.
- Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

:::


#### The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

We are [social creatiures](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md), highly affected by our [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md). Our first habits are not a conscious choice we make, rather an [Imitation](/notes/imitation.md) of others. We tend to imitate those closest to us, the majority, and the powerful. The stronger the crowd, the more likely we will imitate them. Whether because we want to fit it, or afraid of being outcast, we embrace the identity of the group, which leads to a change in our behavior.

:::note[The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits]

- We don‚Äôt choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the script handed down by our friends and family, our church or school, our local community and society at large.
- the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits.
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
- The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits.
- When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.
- Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire.
- if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.

:::


#### How to Find and Fix the Cause of Your Bad Habits

The craving we get from the cue is not dependent on the cue itself. For example, some people see a hamburger and are filled with hunger, others are might be disgusted by it. Which craving matches which cue is a matter of [Framing](/notes/framing.md). The emotions serve as [information](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md) for what was the best solution when we encountered the same situation last time.

Doing something fun right after we get out of bed can cause our alarm clock to be something energizing, and not demoralizing. While it's hard, we can reprogram the craving per cue by forcing a new sensation over the cue. For example, if every time I see a dog I will eat chocolate, I will associate dogs with the positive sensation of eating chocolate, which overall will cause me to enjoy seeing dogs more.

:::note[How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits]

- there are many different ways to address the same underlying motive.
- Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.
- Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not.
- our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves.
- Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.
- Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course of action.
- the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again.
- You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience.
- The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. It‚Äôs not easy, but if you can

:::


### Make it Easy

#### Walk Slowly but Never backwards

Planning can be a form of [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md). We try to do everything perfectly, yet we should remember that [Perfect is the enemy of good](/notes/perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good.md). Research shows that [practice beats perfection](/notes/practice-beats-perfection.md). The more we do, the better at something we become, even if we spend less time planning it to perfection.

The more we practice, the more something becomes a habit, which is easier to maintain.

:::note[Walk Slowly, but Never Backward]

- When you‚Äôre in motion, you‚Äôre planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don‚Äôt produce a result.
- motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself.
- motion allows us to feel like we‚Äôre making progress without running the risk of failure.
- When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don‚Äôt want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.
- If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.
- Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity.
- repetition is a form of change.

:::


#### The Law of Least Effort

Habits are only possible if you don't have any [Friction](/notes/friction.md) blocking your way of doing them. In essence, [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md). The more we simplify the process, the more we remove barriers from activating them, the easier it is to maintain good habits.

:::note[The Law of Least Effort]

- Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required, the less likely it is to occur.
- The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge.
- One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice environment design.
- Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.
- us, a little bit of friction can be the difference between sticking with a good habit or sliding into a bad one.

:::


#### How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two Minute Rule

at first, [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md) is more important than optimization. Doing our habits, even on a small scale, is a form of positioning, where one good choice leads to another. That's why it's important to start small. Adopt a strategy like the [Five minute rule](/notes/5-minute-rule.md), where you try to do it for just five minutes, without feeling guilty if you stop afterwards. The momentum will likely carry you past the 5 minutes, but even just five is enough.

A series of small steps can have huge differences along the way.

:::note[How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule]

- Decisive moments set the options available to your future self.
- Each day is made up of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that determine the path you take.
- A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy.
- you want is a ‚Äúgateway habit‚Äù that naturally leads you down a more productive path.
- Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.
- always stay below the point where it feels like work.
- Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Then, advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process‚Äîfocusing
- How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
- Commitment devices increase the odds that you‚Äôll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present.
- The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don‚Äôt even have the option to act.
- By utilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and technology, you can create an environment of inevitability‚Äîa space where good habits are not just an outcome you hope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed.

:::


#### How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

Using [Commitment Devices](/notes/commitment-devices.md) is useful because they increase the friction of doing bad habits so much that it's practically impossible to implement them. When the "bad option" is not available, it's much easier to choose to do the right thing.

Also, these commitment devices can be a form of automation, that past the [initial setup](/notes/upfront-costs.md), can serve as long term investments, like making an automated savings plan

### Make it Satisfying

#### The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change

The reason we often opt to bad habits and avoid doing good habits is not because we lack the knowledge [Akrasia](/notes/akrasia.md), it's because we have a [Present Bias](/notes/present-bias.md).

Usually bad habits have immediate benefits (like eating junk food), but the costs are in the future (gaining weight). For good habits it's the reverse.

While it's honorable to be able to delay gratification, being smart (rather than working hard), means to make the good habits immediately gratifying as well. It's important to choose a reward that matches your identity. For example, choosing junk food as a reward for maintaining a diet is counterproductive, but watching your favorite show is great.

:::note[The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change]

- if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to repeat it.
- Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.
- The first three laws of behavior change‚Äî
- increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time.
- The fourth law of behavior change‚Äî
- increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop.
- We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.
- With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.
- It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.
- Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.

#### How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

A good method for sticking with your habits is habit tracking. Marking an "x" each time you fulfill the habit has several benefits:
1. It provides visibility - your hard work feels noticed
2. It is satisfying - it provides a sense of accomplishment
3. It gives accountability -you don't want to break the chain

However we will likely miss a day once in a while. What's important is to *not miss twice*. Once is acceptable, twice is losing the habit.

Also, we need to not give too much importance to the habit tracking, because otherwise we focus on the score rather than the habit it serves [Goodhart‚Äôs Law](/notes/goodhart‚Äôs-law.md). For example, we might eat one bite of a cucumber and consider it as "ate healthy" just to check the habit.

:::note[How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day]

- Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.
- Habit tracking also keeps you honest.
- Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you‚Äôre focused on the process rather than the result.
- habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don‚Äôt want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.
- The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.
- The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it.
- Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture,
- just because you can measure something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the most important thing. And just because you can‚Äôt measure something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not important at all.

#### How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

We are very responsive to punishments. We hate losing, it serves as a powerful lesson. That's why being accountable for our habits can be a strong force for maintaining them.

For example, signing a contract that if you fail to stick with your habits, you will have to pay money or humiliate yourself, it's less likely for you to fail.

The more immediate, concrete and related to the act the punishment is, the more effective it is.

:::note[How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything]

- The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it.
- the strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct.
- the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the consequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior.
- An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.

### ADVANCED TACTICS How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great

The most successful habits are the result of an alignment between the habits you choose and your personality. When you are [passionate](/notes/passion.md) about something, it would be easier to gather the necessary motivation, and to sustain this habit.

At first, it will probably take a series of experiments to find out what drives us, and how best to preform it. Even after you have found your method, keep 10% of your time dedicated to it to explore new ways or ideas. Make sure to keep the habit [Challenging](/notes/struggle.md), to both make sure you are improving each day, and to avoid [Boredom](/notes/boredom.md)

#### The Truth about Talent

Some habits are easier depending on the person. For example a short person would have a hard time being a good basketball player. You should choose the habits that corresponds with your personality and [Skill synthesis](/notes/skill-synthesis.md), and we need to [accept](/notes/acceptance.md) that not all habits are a good fit for us, although for every category of activity (like sports, art), there should be a habit that fits [practice beats talent](/notes/practice-beats-talent.md).

To identity which habits are a good fit, ask yourself:
1. What feels like fun to me, but work to others
2. What makes me lose track of time
3. Where do I get greater returns than the average person
4. What comes naturally to me

Also, keep on experimenting and searching for new habits/ways of fulfilling them, especially if you feel that they don't work.

Let go of [Comparisons](/notes/comparisons.md), you should only focus on improving yourself and surpassing your [Limits](/notes/limits.md)

:::note[The truth about talent]

- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.
- Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.
- When our environment changes, so do the qualities that determine success.
- direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability.
- You don‚Äôt have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.
- In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration.
- After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you‚Äôve found‚Äîbut keep experimenting occasionally.
- work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent.
- What feels like fun to me, but work to others?
- What makes me lose track of time?
- Where do I get greater returns than the average person?
- What comes naturally to me?
- When you can‚Äôt win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out.
- People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.
- Until you work as hard as those you admire, don‚Äôt explain away their success as luck.

#### The Goldilocks Rule: how to Stay Motivated in Life and Work

Eventually we will get bored, which is a risk for maintaining habit more than failure. One way of keeping motivation and avoiding boredom is to make sure you are always challenged, that it's not too easy or too hard.

However, even in those cases boredom will eventually come. You will feel bored writing, weight lifting, acting every day, that's why [grit](/notes/grit.md) and consistency are key traits that will carry us when motivation fails. This is the difference between professionals and amateurs. Some work consistently even when motivation is lacking, others do only when they feel like it.

:::note[The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work]

- Once a habit has been established, however, it‚Äôs important to continue to advance in small ways. These little improvements and new challenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a flow state.*
- Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying.
- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.
- If you‚Äôre already interested in a habit, working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way to keep things interesting.
- if you only do the work when it‚Äôs convenient or exciting, then you‚Äôll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.

#### The Downside of Creating Good Habits

The upside of habits is also their downside. Habits turn actions into automatic, but when they are automatic it is hard to improve. We need to combine habits with [Deliberate Practice](/notes/deliberate-practice.md). The way to be mindful of what still needs improvement and practice and what we are already "nailing" that we can automate requires [Periodical Review](/notes/periodical-review.md).

Similarly, our identity should be [flexible](/notes/adaptability.md) as well. A change in the circumstances requires a change in our identity. If we cling too tight to the old identity, we won't be able to thrive. For example, an athlete that is injured will suffer if they try to hold on to their identity as an athlete despite the circumstances which suggest a different life for them now [self](/notes/self.md)

:::note[The Downside of Creating Good Habits]

- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors.
- Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement.
- The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.
- When chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than brittle.
- your identity works with the changing circumstances rather than against them.

### Conclusion - the Secret to Results that Last

The power of habits is when they compound, both over time and between habits. Our goal is not to reach a deadline, but to constantly refine the process.
