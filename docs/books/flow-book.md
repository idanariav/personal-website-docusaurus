## ✒️ Note-Making

### 💡Clarify
🔈 *Summary of main ideas*
happiness, purpose and success is achieved through flow states, which is a combination of challenge, clear goals and feedback, based on our agency. These will create order in our mental state, and improve quality of life and opportunities to grow.
1. **Meaning and happiness are crafted** - we shouldn't look for happiness "out there", it is not something we do, it is something we create, a decision we make based on our perspective and attitude to the world
2. **Flow is connection** - being in flow, or "in the zone", is when we immerse ourselves completely in a task, we have autonomy, challenge, and feedback to help us stay focused, and when it is combined with a sense of purpose, it can be a strong contributor to happiness.

⛓ *Life lessons, action items*

### 🔍Critique

✅ *by following this method, what will happen?*
I liked the intro since it was much more philosophical than I thought it would be

❌ *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*
The main problem with me about the book is that he often uses examples for Nazis as people who were in a "flow" state, which is at minimal triggering and at most is an insult to his own theory that shows how meaningless it is.
For me a flow can only be generated from an activity that promotes mankind in a certain way, whether it is stretching the boundaries of human knowledge, of the human body, or acting in services of humanity. Meaning that flow is necessarily connected to culture and ethics, it cant really be a mechanical state.

🧱 *Implementations and limitations of it are...*

### 🗨️Review

💭 *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
similar to other cases, the actual content of the book is the first 10-20% of the book, and the rest are examples of implementations that don't add much since the main message is pretty clear.

### 🖼️Outline

## 📒 Notes

### Intro

**True moments of happiness come from situations where we are in control of our actions**, we use our [Agency](/notes/agency.md) and choose to do something that stretches' our psychical or mental limits. Happiness isn't something we do, nor is it something passive that just "happens" to us. [Happiness is an internal state](/notes/happiness-is-an-internal-state.md)

### Happiness Revisited:

1. **the universe was not made for us**, it is not "guarantied" that we will have satisfactory life. troubles and difficulties will arise [Life is pain](/notes/life-is-pain.md)
2. **we relate our happiness on external, usually material things**, that can either be too easy or too hard to get. in the former, things that come easy are not as enjoyable, since it becomes our new reference line (we eat better than kings of the past, but we're not as satisfied from these feast) [Hedonic Treadmill](/notes/hedonic-treadmill.md) [Minimalism](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md), we also tend to avoid future obstacles since we expect everything to be easy [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md). in the latter, if its too hard that it just breeds frustration.
3. **desire is never ending**, once we get what we want, we immediately focus on the next goal. [Desire](/notes/desire.md)
without focusing internality, on how we treat our experiences, we will never be truly happy.
This will only result by finding a way to free our consciousness, which is always a method that requires not only cognitive strength, but also emotional, since otherwise we will not act upon it [Morality is both rational and emotional](/notes/morality-is-both-rational-and-emotional.md) [Self Reflection](/notes/introspection.md)
also, it is always based on the [context](/notes/context.md) of the current culture, like during mark's time it was about being free from economical pressure, while in ancient times it was more about psychical suffering.
Essentially, this **freedom comes from the ability to separate the external and inner world**, [Stoicism](/notes/stoicism.md)

:::note[HAPPINESS REVISITED]

- happiness is not something that happens. It is not the result of good fortune or random chance. It is not something that money can buy or power command. It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on how we interpret them. Happiness, in fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person.
- The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.
- What would really satisfy people is not getting slim or rich, but feeling good about their lives.
- “Flow” is the way people describe their state of mind when consciousness is harmoniously ordered, and they want to pursue whatever they are doing for its own sake.
- Only direct control of experience, the ability to derive moment-by-moment enjoyment from everything we do, can overcome the obstacles to fulfillment.
- There is not much that we as individuals can do to change the way the universe runs. In our lifetime we exert little influence over the forces that interfere with our well-being.
- How we feel about ourselves, the joy we get from living, ultimately depend directly on how the mind filters and interprets everyday experiences. Whether we are happy depends on inner harmony, not on the controls we are able to exert over the great forces of the universe.
- This paradox of rising expectations suggests that improving the quality of life might be an insurmountable task. In fact, there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way.
- When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity.
- Daunted by the futility of trying to keep up with all the demands they cannot possibly meet, some will just surrender and retire gracefully into relative oblivion.
- while humankind collectively has increased its material powers a thousandfold, it has not advanced very far in terms of improving the content of experience.
- To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances.
- seeking pleasure is a reflex response built into our genes for the preservation of the species, not for the purpose of our own personal advantage.
- If a person learns to enjoy and find meaning in the ongoing stream of experience, in the process of living itself, the burden of social controls automatically falls from one’s shoulders.
- Control over consciousness is not simply a cognitive skill. At least as much as intelligence, it requires the commitment of emotions and will.
- if the conditions in which we live change that rapidly—it becomes necessary to rethink and reformulate what it takes to establish autonomy in consciousness.

### The Anatomy of Consciousness
**[consciousness](/notes/consciousness.md) is our ability to process external stimuli and decide on a course of action**.
attention is our limited mental energy, and it depletes as we use it, so we must use it wisely. [Willpower is Limited](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md)
There are situations where being focused is easier than others. **When external stimulus matches our personal goals, we are aligned, in harmony.** In contrast with entropy when "everything goes wrong". (since we cannot control out external world so easily, it is best done by fixing our perception). [Life as Flow](/notes/life-as-flow.md)
When we focus on the task at hand and achieve that sense of harmony, we paradoxically advance towards our personal goals, while being completely selfish and focused on doing things better.

:::note[THE ANATOMY OF CONSCIOUSNESS]

- The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal,
- Attention is like energy in that without it no work can be done, and in doing work it is dissipated. We create ourselves by how we invest this energy.
- Whenever information disrupts consciousness by threatening its goals we have a condition of inner disorder, or psychic entropy, a disorganization of the self that impairs its effectiveness.
- The opposite state from the condition of psychic entropy is optimal experience. When the information that keeps coming into awareness is congruent with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly.
- When we choose a goal and invest ourselves in it to the limits of our concentration, whatever we do will be enjoyable.

### Enjoyment and the Quality of Life

the flow experience is achieved when:
1. **the task is challenging** - on the borderline between boredom and anxiety (not too easy, not too hard). [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md)
2. **The task has clear goals and visible [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md)** [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md)
3. **We are capable to exert control on the situation**, not necessarily have complete control (the example is poker players - skills matter, while luck is still relevant).

in such task, we tend to give all of our attention to the task at hand, thus making us *forget ourselves*, or forget our sense of selves while being completely immersed in the task, we usually also forget the sense of time.

:::note[ENJOYMENT AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE]

- if a person is not in control of his consciousness, the old fears or desires will soon return, reviving previous anxieties.
- quality of life does not depend directly on what others think of us or on what we own. The bottom line is, rather, how we feel about ourselves and about what happens to us. To improve life one must improve the quality of experience.
- Enjoyment is characterized by this forward movement: by a sense of novelty, of accomplishment.
- optimal experience, and the psychological conditions that make it possible, seem to be the same the world over.
- Enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the person’s capacity to act.
- unless a person learns to set goals and to recognize and gauge feedback in such activities, she will not enjoy them.
- activities that produce flow experiences, even the seemingly most risky ones, are so constructed as to allow the practitioner to develop sufficient skills to reduce the margin of error to as close to zero as possible.
- what people enjoy is not the sense of being in control, but the sense of exercising control in difficult situations.
- enjoyable activities that produce flow have a potentially negative aspect: while they are capable of improving the quality of existence by creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at which point the self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and is then unwilling to cope with the ambiguities of life.
- When experience is intrinsically rewarding life is justified in the present, instead of being held hostage to a hypothetical future gain.

### The Conditions of Flow

there is a similarity between cultures and flow experiences (such as games): both define clear rules, goals and feedback in order to increase that participates happiness.

Also, two cultural "illnesses" are similar to personal cases *where flow is harder to achieve*:
1. **Anomia** - when a culture "break" and there is no longer clear rules on how to act and what to expect [Ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md)
2. **Alienation** - There is no meaning anymore in following the rules, they don't match the personal and societal goals, such as doing meaningless labor at the factory. [Alienation](/notes/alienation.md)

the two personal problems are:
1. **lack of focus** - if its hard to concentrate on a given thing, we would no longer be able to connect to the flow by understanding the goals and rules, since our attention would shift to different things. [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md)
2. **Self centered** - if we only focus on ourselves during the task, we will not achieve flow [Self Bias](/notes/self-bias.md)

:::note[THE CONDITIONS OF FLOW]

- One cannot enjoy doing the same thing at the same level for long. We grow either bored or frustrated; and then the desire to enjoy ourselves again pushes us to stretch our skills, or to discover new opportunities for using them.
- flow activities are freely chosen and more intimately related to the sources of what is ultimately meaningful, they are perhaps more precise indicators of who we are.
- Cultures prescribe norms, evolve goals, build beliefs that help us tackle the challenges of existence.
- When a person cannot control psychic energy, neither learning nor true enjoyment is possible.
- people who can enjoy themselves in a variety of situations have the ability to screen out stimulation and to focus only on what they decide is relevant for the moment.
- When adversity threatens to paralyze us, we need to reassert control by finding a new direction in which to invest psychic energy, a direction that lies outside the reach of external forces.

:::


### The Body in Flow

We can and should treat our body and our physical activities with the same mindset in order to produce flow experiences, for example walking, sports and sex are areas where we can experience flow by introducing goals and challenges, beyond the simple development of the body.

### The Flow of Thought

:::note[THE FLOW OF THOUGHT]

- The better route for avoiding chaos in consciousness, of course, is through habits that give control over mental processes to the individual, rather than to some external source of stimulation,

:::


### Work as Flow

work is the place where we can grow the most, since it is the closest and easiest place to generate flow experiences, in contrast with our leisure time which is unstructured and tend to be of low quality. **The key is to turn work from something boring, that promotes foreign goals, the sense of alienation from work, to something enjoyable and an opportunity to grow** [job crafting](/notes/job-crafting.md).

:::note[WORK AS FLOW]

- these individuals transformed the jobs they had to do into complex activities. They did this by recognizing opportunities for action where others did not, by developing skills, by focusing on the activity at hand, and allowing themselves to be lost in the interaction so that their selves could emerge stronger afterward.
- any job could be changed so as to make it more enjoyable by following the prescriptions of the flow model.
- when it comes to work, people do not heed the evidence of their senses. They disregard the quality of immediate experience, and base their motivation instead on the strongly rooted cultural stereotype of what work is supposed to be like.
- The flow experience that results from the use of skills leads to growth; passive entertainment leads nowhere.

:::


### Enjoying Solitude and Other People

relationships are key to our quality of life, but we most also be able to withstand moments of [Solitude](/notes/solitude.md). **it is within these moments where we are tested, whether we are able to turn them into worthwhile activities, or whether we are drawn towards chaos and escapism**, by watching the tv for example.

the key to being a good friend, parent or partner, is to **treat those relationships as potential flow experiences**. Introduce new challenges and opportunities to grow and learn, look for feedback and set goals.

:::note[ENJOYING SOLITUDE AND OTHER PEOPLE]

- If we learn to make our relations with others more like flow experiences, our quality of life as a whole is going to be much improved.
- a person who learns to get along with others is going to make a tremendous change for the better in the quality of life as a whole.
- human relations are malleable, and if a person has the appropriate skills their rules can be transformed.
- We need external goals, external stimulation, external feedback to keep attention directed. And when external input is lacking, attention begins to wander, and thoughts become chaotic—resulting in the state we have called “psychic entropy”
- A person who rarely gets bored, who does not constantly need a favorable external environment to enjoy the moment, has passed the test for having achieved a creative life.
- One can survive solitude, but only if one finds ways of ordering attention that will prevent entropy from destructuring the mind.
- It is much easier for a person to try developing her potential if she knows that no matter what happens, she has a safe emotional base in the family.
- no social change can come about until the consciousness of individuals is changed first.

:::


### Cheating Chaos

to avoid the chaos and negative effects of the outside world that will surly come [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md), one must become a autotelic person, which is a person with inner intrinsic goals.
to do that, one must:
1. **Transform emotions** - use [Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md), turn negative situations to a force for improvement
2. **Immersion** - immerse yourself in the environment, learn the situation instead of being focused on you
3. **Reflect** - take a moment to look for new solutions to the problem. [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md)

:::note[CHEATING CHAOS]

- Subjective experience is not just one of the dimensions of life, it is life itself. Material conditions are secondary: they only affect us indirectly, by way of experience. Flow, and even pleasure, on the other hand, benefit the quality of life directly.
- External supports by themselves are not that effective in mitigating stress. They tend to help only those who can help themselves. And psychological resources are largely outside our control. It is difficult to become much smarter, or much more outgoing, than one was at birth. But how we cope is both the most important factor in determining what effects stress will have and the most flexible resource, the one most under our personal control.
- Unless men learned various tricks for transforming the forces of disorder into something they could use, we would not have survived as successfully as we have.
- those who know how to transform a hopeless situation into a new flow activity that can be controlled will be able to enjoy themselves, and emerge stronger from the ordeal.
- if one operates with unselfconscious assurance, and remains open to the environment and involved in it, a solution is likely to emerge.
- The autotelic individual grows beyond the limits of individuality by investing psychic energy in a system in which she is included. Because of this union of the person and the system, the self emerges at a higher level of complexity.

### The Making of Meaning

**Meaning is our unified purpose, what gives us motivation and reason for action**. It is the underlying narrative of all our flow experiences.

Usually, a sense of meaning involves a process of inner development, similar to [Maslows pyramid](/notes/maslows-pyramid.md), from focusing on basic physical needs, to our community, self actualization, and a sense of [Oneness](/notes/unity.md) with the world.

**Such a sense can only be achieved by practicing self knowledge and action**. Action without thought is blind, and self reflection alone is futile. We must be a combination of both.
Since it is possible that a meaning won't necessarily be moral, we also have to tend to our virtues. [to be moral is to act moral](/notes/to-be-moral-is-to-act-moral.md)
A good meaning comes from within, and not determined by external factors, usually from a place of struggle or important challenge you experienced. [Meaning is Crafted](/notes/meaning-is-crafted.md)

Meaning will give order to the mind, countering the external chaos, and combat the problems of freedom and [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md) of the human experience. [Absurdity of existence](/notes/absurdity-of-existence.md)

:::note[THE MAKING OF MEANING]

- Much of what we call culture and civilization consists in efforts people have made, generally against overwhelming odds, to create a sense of purpose for themselves and their descendants.
- Creating meaning involves bringing order to the contents of the mind by integrating one’s actions into a unified flow experience.
- People who find their lives meaningful usually have a goal that is challenging enough to take up all their energies,
- Someone who is in harmony no matter what he does, no matter what is happening to him, knows that his psychic energy is not being wasted on doubt, regret, guilt, and fear, but is always usefully employed.
- Every human culture, by definition, contains meaning systems that can serve as the encompassing purpose by which individuals can order their goals.
- Complexity requires that we invest energy in developing whatever skills we were born with, in becoming autonomous, self-reliant, conscious of our uniqueness and of its limitations. At the same time we must invest energy in recognizing, understanding, and finding ways to adapt to the forces beyond the boundaries of our own individuality.
- Commitment to a goal and to the rules it entails is much easier when the choices are few and clear.
- each person must discover ultimate purpose on his or her own. Through trial and error, through intense cultivation, we can straighten out the tangled skein of conflicting goals, and choose the one that will give purpose to action.
- Activity and reflection should ideally complement and support each other. Action by itself is blind, reflection impotent.
