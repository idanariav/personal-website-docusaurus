## ‚úíÔ∏è Note-Making

### üí°Clarify
üîà *Summary of main ideas*
1. **Focus on doing, not being** - Forget how you are perceived, forget what people are saying about you. Focus on brining value to others, on doing, on growing. Be the best version of yourself that you can be, rather than polish a fake empty version of your accomplishments.
2. **Be humble** - even when you succeed, don't let it go to your head. You are not "a gift to the world", you are entitled of nothing, and your success has probably lots to do with the help of others and luck, you are standing on the shoulders of others. Focus on your values and on the path ahead, act as if you have achieved nothing.
3. **You will fail** - accept that it will happen, but also that it means nothing about who you are as a person. Accept responsibility, learn from it, and move on. Don't do "double or nothing", just go back to your first principles and keep doing what you do best. Success is doing your best, and failure is only when you betray your values.

### üóíÔ∏èRelate

‚õì *Life lessons, action items*
 our own ego can be our biggest enemy. It makes us overconfident, delusional and it deprives us of enjoying the small successes in life. We have to be humble, learning and do the work. Understand that failure is a natural part of life and don't let it be the downfall of your ego.
### üîçCritique

‚úÖ *by following this method, what will happen?*
To be humble, to ever be the student, and realize that failure is a natural part of life. All these are good ideas. Also the "do, don't say" message is very strong.

‚ùå *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*
Some cases the narrative is very "Christiaan" in terms of "turn the other cheek", and I think that sometimes it might neglect the positive effects of anger or frustration, for example in cases of justice, or even being treated fairly at work, to avoid humiliation and harassment and things like that. Not that he supports it but it might be perceived that way.

üß± *Implementations and limitations of it are...*

### üó®Ô∏èReview

üí≠ *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
I really appreciate what this book is trying to do. Its very honest and its interesting to see the less familiar sides of famous people, their moments of failure and setbacks and how they overcome them. The book is short and it fits the message that its trying to pass along. The chapters are nice and easy to read.

### üñºÔ∏èOutline

## üìí Notes

### Introduction

Our ego is a problematic aspect of ourselves that's holding us back. It makes us delusional, with a sense of self-importance and over estimate our abilities. [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md) It disconnects us from others (since we know best, or that we're hard to sympathize), and it makes us focus only on the narrow definition of success, at the price of giving up everything else.

Instead we have to have [Humility](/notes/humility.md), to be satisfied from what we have and our successes and learn from our mistakes. [Failure](/notes/failure.md)

:::note[INTRODUCTION]

- Wherever you are, whatever you‚Äôre doing, your worst enemy already lives inside you: your ego.
- The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition.
- ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have: Of mastering a craft. Of real creative insight. Of working well with others. Of building loyalty and support. Of longevity. Of repeating and retaining your success. It repulses advantages and opportunities. It‚Äôs a magnet for enemies and errors.
- Without an accurate accounting of our own abilities compared to others, what we have is not confidence but delusion.
- Humble in our aspirations Gracious in our success Resilient in our failures
- Only when free of ego and baggage can anyone perform to their utmost.

:::


### Part 1 - Aspirations

The greater the [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md) we face, the more we tend to switch "doing" with "saying". We publish our thoughts, opinions, a false pretense as if we are successful without focusing on the actual task at hand [Image vs core](/notes/form-vs-essence.md). Even [Planning](/notes/planning.md) can become a form of [Procrastination](/notes/procrastination.md). Let the actions speak for you [to be moral is to act moral](/notes/to-be-moral-is-to-act-moral.md)

Every moment in life we can choose between "doing something" and "being someone". Ego wants us to be someone, to focus on our image, while true success and satisfaction is about doing. It also includes learning, and the realization that you can always improve. [Lifelong Learning](/notes/lifelong-learning.md) [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) in contrast with Egoistic that stay the same and even fall back because they think they are the best. [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md)

[Passion](/notes/passion.md) is another problem, it causes us to be blind to the situation and to falsely estimate our ability to face problems [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md). A good passion is filled with a sense of purpose, alongside a realistic perception of reality. Don't envy others.

Instead of chasing your own greatness, help others. Master the fundamentals. Be a "clean slate". Identify opportunities and meet new people. **Don't focus on credit, focus on creating value**. Be the least important person in the room, until your actions would make you the most important.

Don't respond to insults, to step down to their level. Keep your behavior calm and collected. Don't focus on your self image, focus on the present and not what they might think about you.

Don't be arrogant, be willing to do the work (as much and as hard as it gets). Be yourself.

:::note[ASPIRE]

- ‚ÄúTalent is only the starting point.‚Äù The question is: Will you be able to make the most of it? Or will you be your own worst enemy? Will you snuff out the flame that is just getting going?
- the ability to evaluate one‚Äôs own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible.
- What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness.

:::


:::note[TALK, TALK, TALK]

- what is scarce and rare? Silence. The ability to deliberately keep yourself out of the conversation and subsist without its validation. Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong.
- After spending so much time thinking, explaining, and talking about a task, we start to feel that we‚Äôve gotten closer to achieving it. Or worse, when things get tough, we feel we can toss the whole project aside because we‚Äôve given it our best try, although of course we haven‚Äôt.
- The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other.

:::


:::note[TO BE OR TO DO?]

- To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That‚Äôs when you will have to make a decision.‚Äù

:::


:::note[BECOME A STUDENT]

- The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice, because it prevents us from getting any better. Studious self-assessment is the antidote.
- To become great and to stay great, they must all know what came before, what is going on now, and what comes next. They must internalize the fundamentals of their domain and what surrounds them, without ossifying or becoming stuck in time. They must be always learning. We must all become our own teachers, tutors, and critics.
- There is no excuse for not getting your education, and because the information we have before us is so vast, there is no excuse for ever ending that process either.

:::


:::note[DON‚ÄôT BE PASSIONATE]

- your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with‚Äîno, because of‚Äîpassion.
- Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous.
- What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective.

:::


:::note[FOLLOW THE CANVAS STRATEGY]

- attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful and subsume your identity into theirs and move both forward simultaneously. It‚Äôs certainly more glamorous to pursue your own glory‚Äîthough hardly as effective. Obeisance is the way forward.
- Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you‚Äôre the least important person in the room‚Äîuntil you change that with results.

:::


:::note[RESTRAIN YOURSELF]

- Those who have subdued their ego understand that it doesn‚Äôt degrade you when others treat you poorly; it degrades them.

:::


:::note[GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD]

- What successful people do is curb such flights of fancy. They ignore the temptations that might make them feel important or skew their perspective.

:::


:::note[THE DANGER OF EARLY PRIDE]

- Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride.
- If you‚Äôre doing the work and putting in the time, you won‚Äôt need to cheat, you won‚Äôt need to overcompensate.
- ‚ÄúThe first product of self-knowledge is humility,‚Äù

:::


:::note[WORK, WORK, WORK]

- it‚Äôs all within reach‚Äîfor all of us, provided we have the constitution and humbleness to be patient and the fortitude to put in the work.
- The material we‚Äôve been given genetically, emotionally, financially, that‚Äôs where we begin. We don‚Äôt control that. We do control what we make of that material, and whether we squander it.

:::


:::note[FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY]

- what is truly ambitious is to face life and proceed with quiet confidence in spite of the distractions. Let others grasp at crutches. It will be a lonely fight to be real, to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to take the edge off.‚Äù To say, ‚ÄúI am going to be myself, the best version of that self.

:::


### Part 2 - Success

**Always try to learn. new challenges will require new skills and knowledge. Learn from wherever you can, challenge yourself, don't stay in the comfort zone.**

Don't think that its all a part of your "great narrative", the success was "your destiny". Focus on Doing. Don't lose your path, remember why you set out to do what you do. Don't skip between goals. Don't be drunk with power, you are entitled of nothing, It will only cause self fulfilling paranoias.

The more you progress, the responsibility shifts from doing to making decisions, to seeing the bigger picture, and to [Trust](/notes/trust.md) those under you to do their work. [Micro-Management](/notes/micro-management.md) is a source for disasters. **Don't have grandeur complex, you are an individual in a long chain of human excellency and creativity. You are standing on the shoulders of giants.**

Be aware, think of the long term. Be loyal to your values, and don't be delusional because of your own success. Know that life includes up and downs, be ready for failure.

:::note[SUCCESS]

- Success is intoxicating, yet to sustain it requires sobriety. We can‚Äôt keep learning if we think we already know everything.

:::


:::note[ALWAYS STAY A STUDENT]

- If you‚Äôre not still learning, you‚Äôre already dying.
- An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even, occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process.

:::


:::note[DON‚ÄôT TELL YOURSELF A STORY]

- Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution‚Äîand on executing with excellence.

:::


:::note[WHAT‚ÄôS IMPORTANT TO YOU?]

- it‚Äôs absolutely critical that you know who you‚Äôre competing with and why, that you have a clear sense of the space you‚Äôre in.
- it‚Äôs not about beating the other guy. It‚Äôs not about having more than the others. It‚Äôs about being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it. It‚Äôs about going where you set out to go. About accomplishing the most that you‚Äôre capable of in what you choose. That‚Äôs it. No more and no less.

:::


:::note[ENTITLEMENT, CONTROL, AND PARANOIA]

- A smart man or woman must regularly remind themselves of the limits of their power and reach.
- The sad feedback loop is that the relentless ‚Äúlooking out for number one‚Äù can encourage other people to undermine and fight us. They see that behavior for what it really is: a mask for weakness, insecurity, and instability.

:::


:::note[MANAGING YOURSELF]

- As you become successful in your own field, your responsibilities may begin to change. Days become less and less about doing

:::


:::note[BEWARE THE DISEASE OF ME]

- This is one of the most dangerous ironies of success‚Äîit can make us someone we never wanted to be in the first place. The Disease of Me can corrupt the most innocent climb.

:::


:::note[MEDITATE ON THE IMMENSITY]

- Creativity is a matter of receptiveness and recognition. This cannot happen if you‚Äôre convinced the world revolves around you.
- Go and put yourself in touch with the infinite, and end your conscious separation from the world. Reconcile yourself a bit better with the realities of life. Realize how much came before you, and how only wisps of it remain.

:::


:::note[FOR WHAT OFTEN COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY]

- Instead of letting power make us delusional and instead of taking what we have for granted, we‚Äôd be better to spend our time preparing for the shifts of fate that inevitably occur in life. That is, adversity, difficulty, failure.

:::


### Part 3 - Failure

It doesn't matter who's [fault](/notes/blame.md) it is, its your [Responsibility](/notes/responsibility.md) to take care of it [Accountability](/notes/accountability.md). Don't be depended on the results, the way the world works and the way they treat you is out of your control and its hard to predict [Stoicism](/notes/stoicism.md). You might not be valued, you might Fail. Focus on the inputs, at working harm and being loyal to yourself and your values. **Success is a mental state, knowing you did your best.** [Standing up for yourself](/notes/standing-up-for-yourself.md)

You will eventually fail, and at that moment you must be aware of the reality and the voices of those around you. Don't go "double or noting", don't push yourself and what you did further into a greater failure [Sunk Cost](/notes/sunk-cost.md). Go back to first principles, to who you are and for good quality work, and get better for next time.
**True failure is only if you betray who you are**, and the only one who suffers from failure is your ego. Failure will probably prompt anger and frustration, those wont get you anywhere, just more self destruction and will hurt those around you. Try to show compassion, understanding and love [Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md)

:::note[FAILURE]

- Whether what you‚Äôre going through is your fault or your problem doesn‚Äôt matter, because it‚Äôs yours to deal with right now.
- Humble and strong people don‚Äôt have the same trouble with these troubles that egotists do. There are fewer complaints and far less self-immolation. Instead, there‚Äôs stoic‚Äîeven cheerful‚Äîresilience. Pity isn‚Äôt necessary. Their identity isn‚Äôt threatened. They can get by without constant validation.
- Dead time is revived when we use it as an opportunity to do what we‚Äôve long needed to do. As they say, this moment is not your life. But it is a moment in your life. How will you use it?

:::


:::note[THE EFFORT IS ENOUGH]

- We have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort‚Äîother people‚Äôs validation, recognition, rewards. So what are we going to do? Not be kind, not work hard, not produce, because there is a chance it wouldn‚Äôt be reciprocated? C‚Äômon.
- the less attached we are to outcomes the better. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the effort‚Äînot the results, good or bad‚Äîis enough.
- ‚ÄúSuccess is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.‚Äù

:::


:::note[FIGHT CLUB MOMENTS]

- Face the symptoms. Cure the disease. Ego makes it so hard‚Äîit‚Äôs easier to delay, to double down, to deliberately avoid seeing the changes we need to make in our lives. But change begins by hearing the criticism and the words of the people around you.
- In the end, the only way you can appreciate your progress is to stand on the edge of the hole you dug for yourself, look down inside it, and smile fondly at the bloody claw prints that marked your journey up the walls.

:::


:::note[DRAW THE LINE]

- The problem is that when we get our identity tied up in our work, we worry that any kind of failure will then say something bad about us as a person. It‚Äôs a fear of taking responsibility, of admitting that we might have messed up. It‚Äôs the sunk cost fallacy. And so we throw good money and good life after bad and end up making everything so much worse.
- When success begins to slip from your fingers‚Äîfor whatever reason‚Äîthe response isn‚Äôt to grip and claw so hard that you shatter it to pieces. It‚Äôs to understand that you must work yourself back to the aspirational phase. You must get back to first principles and best practices.
- The only real failure is abandoning your principles. Killing what you love because you can‚Äôt bear to part from it is selfish and stupid. If your reputation can‚Äôt absorb a few blows, it wasn‚Äôt worth anything in the first place.

:::


:::note[MAINTAIN YOUR OWN SCORECARD]

- Anyone can win. But not everyone is the best possible version of themselves.

:::


:::note[ALWAYS LOVE]

- The more successful or powerful we are, the more there will be that we think we need to protect in terms of our legacy, image, and influence. If we‚Äôre not careful, however, we can end up wasting an incredible amount of time trying to keep the world from displeasing or disrespecting us.

:::


:::note[FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY]

- Whatever is next for us, we can be sure of one thing we‚Äôll want to avoid. Ego. It makes all the steps hard, but failure is the one it will make permanent. Unless we learn, right here and right now, from our mistakes. Unless we use this moment as an opportunity to understand ourselves and our own mind better, ego will seek out failure like true north.

:::


### Epilogue

:::note[EPILOGUE]

- We should want, as I‚Äôve said a few times in this book, to do great things. I know that I do. But no less impressive an accomplishment: being better people, being happier people, being balanced people, being content people, being humble and selfless people. Or better yet, all of these traits together.
