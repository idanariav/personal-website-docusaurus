### 💡Clarify
🔈 *Summary of main ideas*
1. **why we procrastinate** - procrastination is not laziness, it is a logical response to stress, that often stem from:
	1. *fear of failure* - we fear that a failure will be a an indication of our low self worth, that we failed as people, not just the project itself
	2. *exhaustion* - we are too exhausted to work on something, feeling constant stress and burnout
	3. *perfectionism* - we have unrealistic expectations, leading to perfectionism that either prevent us from starting until "everything is ready", or stopping before "everything is perfect"
2. **how to avoid it** - several overlapping solutions to procrastination:
	1. *healthy self talk* - let go of a victim mentality. Replace "shoulds" and "must" with "I choose". Even if you are forced to do something, you control how you do it, and the mentality with which you approach it
	2. *shut off criticism* - remember that it's okay to make mistakes, they say nothing about you as a person. Use meditations, breathing techniques, and guiding questions to accept mistakes as a natural part of progression. Be focused on solutions and what you can do better, not blame.
	3. *make time for play* - schedule guilt free play as the first thing that goes on your calendar, that will fuel you to focus on work
	4. *short work sessions* - don't overwork throughout the day or week, maintain blocks of only 30 minute of focused work
	5. *plan ahead* - distractions will come. Think about potential setbacks that might arise. Similarly, plan from your ultimate deadline backwards so that you will break a big long project into several small steps. Have realistic goals in advance and don't overcommit
### 🗒️Relate

⛓ *by following this method, what will happen? What is the goal of this book?*
We will no longer procrastinate, and start make small yet meaningful progress at our projects
### 🔍Critique

✅ *relevant research, metaphors or examples that helps to convey the argument*
1. Walking on a high ledge - we procrastinate because it feels like walking on a high ledge, where fear makes us freeze. However, if we will have a safe net to fall on, mixed with the feeling that where we are is burning so we can't stay still, we will find the strength to move.
2. Push and pull motivation - instead of using methods that "push" you towards doing something, find the reasons that will "pull" you towards it instead

❌ *the logical jumps, holes or simply cases where it is wrong...*
If we don't schedule work in advance, how are we sure that we will find time to do so? People can fill their schedule with "necessities" and leisure from morning to night. In the end, as he suggests that leisure should be a prize for working, we must schedule some work time

🧱 *Implementations and limitations of it are...*

### 🗨️Review

💭 *my opinions on the book, the writers style...*
The book starts strong, giving a fresh view to why we procrastinate, yet the following methods are simplistic and shallow, and not very interesting.

## 📒 Notes

### Introduction

We want to refresh how we view procrastination, there's a negativity to it, as if those who procrastinate are lazy. That life is hard work and no fun, which is why to succeed you need [Grit](/notes/grit.md) and [Self discipline](/notes/self-control.md).

However, the author claims that procrastination is something else. We procrastinate not because we are lazy, but because we need to, because it makes sense to us.
Common reasons could be:
1. fear of [Failure](/notes/failure.md)
2. an unhealthy amount of [Self Criticism](/notes/self-criticism.md)
3. disinterest [Boredom](/notes/boredom.md)
4. Experiencing [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md) from unrealistic expectations or time management

To reduce procrastination, we can use the "now habit", that will help us:
1. create [Psychological safety](/notes/psychological-safety.md)
2. turn criticism into [self talk](/notes/self-talk.md)
3. use old habits as triggers for new habits
4. schedule time for [Play](/notes/gamification.md) throughout your day
5. effective use of [Time Blocking](/notes/time-blocking.md)
6. think ahead of potential distractions and how to deal with them [Pre-Mortem](/notes/pre-mortem.md)
7. the "unschedule"
8. set realistic goals [Triage](/notes/triage.md)
9. enter a [Flow](/notes/flow.md) state
10. anticipate setbacks (*isn't this a repeat of 6?*)

:::note[INTRODUCTION]

- Procrastination is a mechanism for coping with the anxiety associated with starting or completing any task or decision. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=160))

#### Why We Procrastinate

six warnings sign that we procrastinate
1. **life feels like a series of obligations** - feeling powerless, pressure of doing "todos"
2. **have unrealistic time management** - talks about doing things "someday" or lose control over time)
3. **vague about goals and values** - hard to commit, not knowing what we want, getting easily distracted by [shining new thing](/notes/shining-new-thing.md), bad at prioritizing
4. **feeling unfulfilled** - lack of life satisfaction, self blame and a long list of uncompleted bucket list
5. **indecisiveness** - afraid of taking responsibility, being a perfectionist, thinking you're above mistakes or endless worry about them
6. **low self esteem** - blame others for your faults, fear of criticism

Procrastination is essentially a form of [Escapism](/notes/escapism.md) from [Stress](/notes/stress.md). We try to forget, even for a brief time, that we have a tendency for [Cognitive Alignment](/notes/cognitive-alignment.md), to associate our identity with our work, with what we do. We set unreasonable [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) from ourselves, which only leads to [Blame](/notes/blame.md) and self hate when we fail these impossible standards. We fear our own [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) and others, so we try to avoid it.

All the "just do it" advices turn you into the problem, instead of looking at procrastination as a symptom of a more serious problem. If we believe that what we do is who we are, and criticism on our work is the same as criticism on our identity, then no wonders we turn to procrastination, [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md) and self criticism. It's a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md) that feeds itself. We feel bad when we procrastinate, so we get more self criticism, which increases the urge to procrastinate.

Procrastination "helps" us by being:
1. A way to indirectly resist pressure from authorities [Reactance](/notes/reactance.md)
2. Lessens fear of failure by providing an excuse for disappointment
3. Defense against the fear of success

:::note[WHY WE PROCRASTINATE]

- The Now Habit perspective does not accept that laziness, disorganization, or any other character defect is the reason you procrastinate. Nor does it accept the assumption that people in general are innately lazy, and therefore need pressure to motivate them. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=283))
- procrastination is not a character defect; rather, it is an attempt—albeit an unsatisfactory one—at coping with the often incapacitating fear of having our worth held up for judgment. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=305))
- there is one main reason why we procrastinate: it rewards us with temporary relief from stress. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=401))
- If you believe that a judgment of your work is a judgment of yourself, then perfectionism, self-criticism, and procrastination are necessary forms of protection. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=427))
- Perfectionism and self-criticism are, in fact, the chief causes of fear of failure. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=484))

#### How We Procrastinate

First, in order to reduce procrastination, we need to understand when and how we do it. It requires [tracking](/notes/quantifiable-self.md) how we spend our time. For a whole week, create a log with this description:
1. What was I doing
2. What is the priority of this task
3. how long was I doing it
4. How I felt during it

This would allow us to identify instances where our focus shifts and we procrastinate, and also which activities led to it.

The first solution to procrastination is a sense of safety. What we fear is not the activity itself, but rather it's ramifications on our identity, status or reputation. For example, creating a report at work might be an easy task, but once we know the CEO is going to review it it becomes much more stressful. The same task now became daunting. We would have a higher standard to the point of perfectionism, which would lead us to delay, to procrastinate, only to finally start doing something due to a [Deadline Effect](/notes/deadline-effect.md). All the while we can give excuses that this work isn't a good indication of our quality because we didn't have the time to "give it all"

The difference between successful people and the rest is not that they don't fail, we all do. The difference is that they bounce back [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md)

:::note[HOW WE PROCRASTINATE]

- You need a commitment to yourself and your innate worth that lets you know that, in spite of any failures, you believe in yourself enough to try again, ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=827))
- The successful person fails many times and bounces back; but “The Failure” fails once, letting that one failure become a judgment of his or her worth, ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=830))

:::


#### How to Talk to Yourself

When we use authoritative language towards ourselves, like "I have to do it", or "just do it you lazy bum", we create an [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md) and promote [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md). We are both the one who commands and the one who resists, therefore our energy is similarly split into two, into resisting and cooperating, instead of channeling it all into one place [Multitasking doesnt exist](/notes/multitasking-doesnt-exist.md).

To align our two sides requires using [positive language](/notes/positive-language.md), to [reframe](/notes/framing.md) it as something we choose, to focus on our [Agency](/notes/agency.md), like "I choose to work on..." Focusing on how, when and why you will do this.

Focusing on choice rather than "should" and "must" also shifts our focus from [Comparing](/notes/comparisons.md) ourselves to an impossible standard or dwelling on the past, which choice is [forward thinking](/notes/forward-thinking.md), it focuses on what we can do now, and not blame or [regret](/notes/regret.md) on what might have been.

Even if it is something that we have to do, we choose how to do it, how to approach it, what to project while doing it, that choice is always ours

How to turn from a procrastinator to producer:
1. Replace "I should" with "I choose"
2. Replace "I must finish" with "when can I start working on it"
3. Replace "this is so big and important" with "I can take one small step"
4. Replace "I must be perfect" to "I can be perfectly human"
5. Replace "I don't have time to play" with "I must take time to play"

:::note[HOW TO TALK TO YOURSELF]

- your energy can’t go in two directions at once, nor can your mind focus on two problems. While you decide whether this is an issue of fighting for your freedom or one of tackling a job, your mind and body are frozen in procrastination caused by ambivalent and conflicting messages. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=888))
- Even when the choices are rotten ones, you can exercise your power of choice and learn to embrace the path that makes the most sense to you. ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=1012))

:::


#### Guilt Free Play, Quality Work

Procrastinators and workaholics have some things in common. Both feel crushed by the [Hustle Culture](/notes/hustle-culture.md), with endless work and no time or not deserve to play.

Play, as is [Rest](/notes/rest.md) is essential, not our for our wellbeing, we are even more productive after we rest. Play triggers our [downtime brain](/notes/downtime-brain.md) which helps our creativity, while also filling us with energy.

Having guilt free play should be part of our routine.

There are two ways of motivating ourselves to do something, *push* and *pull*. Most of us use "push" methods, where we use [Punishment](/notes/punishment.md) to force us to do something, which like [External Motivation](/notes/external-motivation.md) fails to motivate us and usually backfires.

However, "pull" methods spark our [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md), they trigger our [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) by creating a connection to the task, and not an external threat that forces us to do so. However, since most tasks are inherently boring, they can't compete with temptations, nor they could be a source for curiosity either. That's why we need to use [Temptation Bundling](/notes/temptation-bundling.md). By making room first for guilt free play, we trigger our creative thinking, and spark energy within us to do the boring task as well. Note that in contrast to common temptation bundling, the temptation comes first. It frees us from the desire to do something else during the boring task because we have already satiated our curiosity. We have played without guilt, without painting this creative flow either as a reward, or as a sin while working [The law of reverse effect](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md)

:::note[GUILT-FREE PLAY, QUALITY WORK]

- to control your work habits you must make the periods of work shorter (less painful) and the rewards more frequent and immediate (more pleasurable)—interlacing ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=1260))

#### Overcoming Blocks to Action

Three main blocks to action:
1. Fear of being overwhelmed
2. Fear of failure
3. Fear of not finishing

Each block has its own cure
1. **The reverse calendar** - instead of looking at a project as a single huge task, break it down to manageable pieces. Start from the deadline, and then work back each tiny step and it's deadline until you reach the present
2. **From worry to work** - to use the boost stress gives us to your advantage, whenever you feel stressed, ask yourself:
	1. What is the worst that could happen
	2. What will you do in that case?
	3. Have can I overcome it?
	4. Which alternatives do I have?
	5. Is there a way to avoid it?
	6. Can I increase my chances of achieving my goal?
3. **Persistent starting** - remind yourself that over preparation is a form of procrastination, that at first the progression rate is slower, and that we have to work with the time available to us, which means submitting before it's "perfect".

Be with [Confidence](/notes/self-worth.md) knowing that you thought about potential pitfalls, you kept yourself focused and motivated, certain you will try your best, yet won't fall into perfectionism.

:::note[OVERCOMING BLOCKS TO ACTION]

- The three major fears that block action and create procrastination are the terror of being overwhelmed, the fear of failure, and the fear of not finishing. ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=1383))
- True confidence is knowing that whether you’re calm or anxious, whether you succeed or fail, you’ll do your best and, if necessary, be ready to pick yourself up to carry on and try again. ([Location 1569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=1569))

#### The Unschedule

Sometimes we procrastinate even though the task itself is very short. To get you started, use the [Pomodoro technique](/notes/pomodoro-technique.md). You'll be surprised how much you can accomplish with half an hour of focused work.

To [plan](/notes/periodical-review.md) your week ahead and use these 30 minute work windows, follow these guiding principles
1. Have one free day a week
2. No more than 20 hours a week on the project
3. No more than 5 hours a day on the project
4. Schedule first your commitments - sleep, meals, family, medical, events
5. do a break every 30 minute session

After using this approach, you will find that not only are you more productive, but you have a better life-work balance [Inverse](/notes/reverse-thinking.md). By first scheduling all your non-work stuff, you will know how much time you truly have, while also ensuring you have a guilt-free play (and rest sessions), that will energize and motivate you to do these 30 minute sessions.

#### Working in the Flow State

Procrastination is the enemy of flow. To enter a flow state requires us to turn off the left, aka analytical, critical side of our mind and let the right side run freely.

Similarly, perfectionism is also the enemy of flow. Because of [First Batch Trash](/notes/first-batch-trash.md), we necessarily create worse ideas at the beginning, and if we criticize ourselves constantly we won't make it to the next levels of quality.

To shut off our critical side, some forms of meditations and breathing exercises are recommended

#### Fine Tunning Your Progress

Use pre mortem to think what are the potential setbacks and points of procrastination that might arise in the project, and use [Simulations](/notes/simulations.md) to plan ahead how will you respond to those.

Don't be afraid of mistakes, they don't define you, cultivate emotional Resilience by remembering that a mistake is not an indication of your worth, nor it's a sign you're going to wrong way. It's a step to getting better. Fulfill your [Will to Power](/notes/will-to-power.md), embrace the challenges and focus on what you can change. Be solutions driven, not problems.

As the urge for distractions rise, if you can't block them in advance, try to [Surf the Urge](/notes/surf-the-urge.md), be with the urge for ten minutes. Notice it, let yourself feel it, yet don't give in to it. Usually it will subside much faster than that.

Goals should be realistic, and clear. Part of what drives us to procrastinate is because we are too stressed from having too many goals [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md). Make a limited amount of realistic goal, and set clear rules to what you are trying to achieve and how.

:::note[FINE-TUNING YOUR PROGRESS]

- “A mistake will not be the end of the world because I won’t let it be. I will pick myself up and will try again—regardless of how embarrassed or hurt I feel.” ([Location 2264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=2264))

:::


#### The Procrastinator in Your Life

Managing procrastinators should be done from a place of empathy, of remembering the reasons why people procrastinate and address these problems in an empowering way, of working [together](/notes/cooperation.md) rather than treating them as the problem [people are not the problem](/notes/people-are-not-the-problem.md).

Focus on commitment (pull) rather than compliance (push), on getting started rather than the deadlines.

:::note[THE PROCRASTINATOR IN YOUR LIFE]

- offer your support, be a sounding board, and help procrastinators be realistic but don’t try to decide things for them or judge their moral character.” ([Location 2512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=2512))
- People learn faster in an environment where praise for steps in the right direction is abundant and criticism is kept constructive and focused on an area that can be improved. ([Location 2639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QNVP7M&location=2639))
