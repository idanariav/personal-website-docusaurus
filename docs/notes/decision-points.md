# Decision Points

## Notes

Decision points (or trip wires) are moments when we are forced to [stop](/notes/rest.md) and reevaluate our decision, or take a new one.

On the one hand, decision points are a form of [Friction](/notes/friction.md), they interrupt the process and force us to make a conscious choice. This also taps our [limited willpower](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md). On the other hand, it can help us avoid [Path Dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md) and [Herd Mentality](/notes/social-environment.md) by making us think about our actions.

Tripwire methods (planned decision points):
1. **Deadlines** - this forces us to justify or review our decision by a certain date, like a falsification condition - for example, if we don't reach 1m customers by x... [Deadline Effect](/notes/deadline-effect.md)
2. **Partition** - we divide our resources into "buckets", and question whether to proceed between buckets. For example, instead of using the entire budget for a project only to discover it takes more money, we will divide it into 20% buckets, and will review whether to stop the project after each 20%. [mental accounting](/notes/mental-accounting.md)
3. **Patterns** - something unexpected happens that requires rethinking our decision. So if x happens, let's discuss.

The problem with decision points, as in other cases, that the [threshold](/notes/threshold-bias.md) we put in place is always arbitrary because it converts a complex reality to a binary case.
