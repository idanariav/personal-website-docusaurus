# Accusation Audit

## Notes

To do an accusation audit means to be honest about our flaws. It means to be proactive about them and expose them first instead of hoping others won't notice them. It means to be vulnerable, which might sound as a strategically bad move, yet vulnerability is shown to be a sign of strength, and a good way to build strong connections and trust.

For example, if you have to do a presentation and you know that there are some disadvantages to your pitch that is on everyone's mind, don't focus just on the positives, be open by saying things like "You probably have doubts about our...". This shows not only that you understand their worldview, and not just trying to sell them something, but this also gives us a chance to reframe these disadvantages and control the Narratives
