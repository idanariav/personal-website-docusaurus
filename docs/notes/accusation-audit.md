# Accusation Audit

## Notes

To do an accusation audit means to be [honest](/notes/honesty.md) about our flaws. It means to be [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md) about them and [expose](/notes/transparency.md) them first instead of hoping others won't notice them. It means to be [vulnerable](/notes/vulnerability.md), which might sound as a strategically bad move, yet vulnerability is shown to be a sign of strength, and a good way to build strong connections and [trust](/notes/trust.md).

For example, if you have to do a presentation and you know that there are some disadvantages to your pitch that is on everyone's mind, don't focus just on the positives, be open by saying things like "You probably have doubts about our...". This shows not only that you understand their worldview, and not just trying to sell them something, but this also gives us a chance to [reframe](/notes/framing.md) these disadvantages and control the [Narratives](/notes/narratives.md)
