# How to Give Praises

## Notes

*You should praise effort, not abilities* - for example "you worked really hard, or it's good when you so x" and not "you are so smart". And more accurately, you should praise efforts in light of outcomes, a combination of struggle + think of ways to improve, because you want them to have both, the ability to work hard [Grit](/notes/grit.md) but also work smart and find constant ways to improve [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md).
When fixed mindset is get positive praise, they are afraid to lose it so they will avoid challenges, and when they get negative labeling they will be afraid that it's correct. Having a growth mindset and praising effort will use these praises as motivation, and learn to avoid negative labeling since it doesn't connect to their identity. [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md).
