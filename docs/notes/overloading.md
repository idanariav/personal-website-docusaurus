# Overloading

## Notes

Overloading is we take too much on ourselves, or spending too much time/energy doing something than we should not or could not handle. It is usually the result of the [Hustle Culture](/notes/hustle-culture.md), which sees busyness as a virtue and rest as a vice, so we take on every single opportunity without stopping.

However, [Rest](/notes/rest.md) is essential to our wellbeing and productivity. Taking more not only leads to [Stress](/notes/stress.md) and eventually [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md), it also has [Diminishing Returns](/notes/diminishing-returns.md), where we are less and less effective, to the point where it could be harmful to the overall productivity, to due [Task Switching](/notes/task-switching.md).

Sometimes being overloaded is not a choice, it is thrust upon us, like kids with parents that fill their schedules with lessons and activities to the brim. [Margins](/notes/reserves.md)

It is not always easy to tell when someone is overloading themselves, and paradoxically we might only see it afterwards as a pressure drop, when we break down after a challenge, not during it.
