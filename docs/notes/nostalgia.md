# Nostalgia

## Notes

Since [Post-Modernism](/notes/post-modernism.md) is about [deconstruction](/notes/deconstruction.md), we can no longer have unified [Narratives](/notes/narratives.md) or grand ideologies that combine us, or give us purpose and goals for the future, after all everything is either [relative](/notes/relativism.md) or without meaning. **If we can't look to others or to the future, then we can only look at the past and inwards**. We become [narcistics](/notes/self-bias.md) and nostalgic, no wonder our economy is selling us nostalgia, and focuses more on [remixing](/notes/imitation.md) than creating something new. **We miss those times where we were unified, where we felt part of something bigger**. Now we are highly individualized, replacing grand dreams with quantitative "cold" measures of success like money or status.
