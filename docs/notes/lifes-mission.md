# Goal Setting

## Notes

It doesn't matter how fast you are going, if you don't have a clear direction, you will never get to where you want to go.

Goals give us direction, [inspire](/notes/inspiration.md) us, and become the core principle from which we derive our daily actions.
Preferably, a goal should be aligned with your [Core Values](/notes/core-values.md), otherwise you will lack the [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) to pursue it. Often, when a goal is deeply connected with our core values, pursuing it can become one of the things that provides [meaning](/notes/meaning-is-crafted.md) in our lives. Having a goal in life is a sign that we want and can do more out of life, that we take a [Life Embracing](/notes/will-to-power.md) perception towards life, to we have a part to play in it and we can make something out of the time we have.

A life mission has to be [clear](/notes/clarity.md), and inspirational, so that it would answer the question "how do I know when I have succeeded", for example - "I will become a doctor in five years".

However, goals can also be harmful if not done right. A common issue is what do we do when we accomplish the goal. We might feel empty, asking ourselves "well, now what?". This is due to the [Hedonic Treadmill](/notes/hedonic-treadmill.md). The feeling of joy of accomplishing our goal quickly fades away, and without a new goal we are left dissatisfied. A goal should not be just a target to reach, but a matter of [expressing](/notes/authenticity.md) and [changing](/notes/transcendence.md) who we are

Another drawback is that even a clear goal doesn't always come with a prescription to how we should follow it, as opposed with habit-like type of thinking that turns high level goals into actionable daily steps [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md). And it is unclear how and if the two should mix. What is more beneficial? Setting a goal to read x books a year, or to set x minutes a day for reading? Are they really mutually exclusive?
