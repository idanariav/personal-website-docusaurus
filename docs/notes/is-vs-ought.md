# Is Vs Ought

## Notes

Is vs ought is a cognitive bias in which we treat the existing situation as a justification for it's existence, this leads to several problems:
1. **Circular reasoning** - a thing should exist because it already exists
2. **Mixing facts and values** - often when we talk about reasons for existing, the answers are imbued with certain values, a subjective answer, on our [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md), rather than a factual one. This means that the phenomenon gets an ideological reasoning simply by existing ("it should because it is").
3. **Limited view** - when we fall into this bias, we lack the ability to use our [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md) to consider other options as to what can exist otherwise.
4. **Mixing cause and effect** - We treat the current situation as the reason, instead of the outcome, for certain beliefs. Like viewing all poor people as lazy because they don't have a job, so they shouldn't receive any social help, which only makes it harder for them to find a job, which strengthens the view that they are too lazy to find a job. [Self fulfilling prophecy](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md)

Both because it is hard to think about the [Counterfactual](/notes/counterfactual.md) (what if...) and because we give credit to things that have [lasted](/notes/shirky-principle.md) long, or at least during our life-time, we fall often to this trap. The reality as it is now is so [familiar](/notes/familiarity-bias.md) that we are too [attached](/notes/attachment.md) to imagine anything else. The reality forms a [Path Dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md) for our thoughts and beliefs.
