# Consent

## Notes

Consent is usually about getting a clear, verbal agreement of the other side to what you are offering. Often we fail to get consent while thinking that we have it simply because we misread the situation [We can't read minds](/notes/theory-of-mind.md). That's why verbal conformation is important and we shouldn't rely on our assumptions.

Consent impowers the other side by giving them a say in the situation, they are no longer a passive viewer but rather capable of making decisions for themselves [Agency](/notes/agency.md). Consent has to be freely given, and can't be coerced, otherwise it is the same as not asking them at all. Accordingly, they should feel free to [say no](/notes/saying-no.md) and not fear hurting the other side [Psychological safety](/notes/psychological-safety.md).
