# Gamification

## Notes

Gamification is when we do an activity mainly because it is fun and gratifying. It usually involves a (Jump:: challenge, perhaps uncertainty, and progression (like video games). This can be either activities that we created for play, or "[boring](/notes/boredom.md)" activities that we convert to "fun" activities. Usually games gives us a sense of [Flow](/notes/flow.md), of being completely invested in what we do while our mind remains clear. While perhaps not a true solution to the problem, it can put [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md) at bay. The logic behind gamifying is the same as behind [Temptation Bundling](/notes/temptation-bundling.md) - to add fun to our tasks to make them more approachable.

Tips for gamifying boring activities:
1. **Make it challenging** - Try to add [Limits](/notes/limits.md) to the task which will turn it into an interesting [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md). For example, try to clean the dishes with as little water as possible, or folding a laundry with only one hand.
2. **Keep it fresh** - do things differently from time to time [Flexability](/notes/adaptability.md). Have a more [curious](/notes/curiosity.md) mindset, try to find new ways of doing the same thing. Approach the task with a [Beginner's Mind](/notes/beginners-mind.md)
3. **Improve your score** - Whichever task you do, try to do it better - perhaps faster, more automated, less resourced used, etc [Optimization](/notes/optimization.md).
