# Objectivism

## Notes

Objectivism is the opposite of [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md), it is to see things "as they are", to focus on facts and remove [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) and [Narratives](/notes/narratives.md) from our life.

It is a genuine question to ask what's left after we have removed all that, and whether we are even capable of seeing anything "as it is" without any processing by our mind or senses beforehand, or are we doomed to see distorted things.

Like trying to see something without a color, is it even possible to see something not through our subjective lenses?

Objectivism, if possible, provides us a way to [zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md), to gain [distance](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md) from the world as we perceive it, and see how it really is. It's a tool that removes [self bias](/notes/self-bias.md), dismantle any sense of [attachment](/notes/attachment.md), and allow us to act more freely without being tied by narratives. A form of [distillment](/notes/distillment.md), of seeing the "true" core of something without to he added [noise](/notes/noise.md)

For example, the [scientific method](/notes/scientific-method.md) takes pride in it's objectivism, and arguably it has helped it uncover the [truth](/notes/truth.md) much better than other theories that are more subjective.
