# Empathy

## Notes

Empathy is our ability to place ourselves in the other person's shoes, to identify with their pain, their struggles, and preferences. This requires us to leave our own [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md) and step int theirs. Therefore, **to be empathic is to see the world through their eyes and trying to make it better based on their definition of good, not yours.** Although, understanding them doesn't mean that we agree with them. Empathy is more than just our ability to [mirror](/notes/mirroring.md) other people, because empathy goes beyond the external layer of displayed emotions into the deep layer of reasons and feelings.

The fact that people are able to be empathetic perhaps it's a sign that we humans are [social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md). It could be argued that the reason that [People are inherently good](/notes/humans-are-good-as-default.md) is because our tendency to empathize causes us to feel pain, so we wish to free ourselves of that pain by solving their problem. However, seeing and sensing too much pain, trying to carry the weight of the world on our shoulders might lead to [Indifference](/notes/indifference.md) as an act of self preservation, blocking empathy from occurring.

At the individual level, empathy is a great way to connect with someone, to bring you closer to a state of [Oneness](/notes/unity.md), while negating feelings of [Loneliness](/notes/loneliness.md) because we are finally seen and heard. Empathy also is the first step towards having our feelings [validated](/notes/validation.md), because understanding is a necessary step to acceptance. When we empathize with another, we are much more likely to be [Altruistic](/notes/giving.md) towards them.

At the social level, it can be argued that empathy promotes [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md), but the question is towards whom? Since it is easier to emphasize we people who are similar to us, it might also support a [us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md) mentality, promoting cooperation with the in group, while distancing ourselves from the out group. This goes against the idea of [Veil of ignorance](/notes/veil-of-ignorance.md), that decisions should be made in an impartial way. If we are empathic, it is like we are choosing who to be biased towards.
