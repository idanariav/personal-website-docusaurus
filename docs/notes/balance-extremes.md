# Balance Extremes

## Notes

[Truth](/notes/truth.md) often lies in the middle, not in the geometrical sense, but rather as a balance between two extreme endpoints. The balance doesn't always have to be in the middle, but it does have to be between those options, or as a new third option that merges these two together. We would be surprised how often [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md). That a less extreme version is not just more moderate, but also a more "true" and holistic form of that view.

Unfortunately, this means that many answers are involved with [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md), there is no simple answer, no "when x do y". . Either extreme option can cause our demise, so the middle is our salvation. That is why we need to constantly evaluate and [adjust](/notes/adaptability.md) to the situation. To use our mental capacity to figure out what is right in this particular [case](/notes/context.md) rather than go with what we believe in, or according to a rigid set of rules [Conformation Bias](/notes/conformation-bias.md).

At the biological level, our body always keep tabs on so many metrics, keeping them balanced between too few and [too much](/notes/overloading.md). It perhaps fuels our desire to resist [change](/notes/life-is-change.md), because we always want to return back to what we consider as the stable state. When it's warm we want it to be colder, when it's cold we wish for warmth. The [Hedonic Treadmill](/notes/hedonic-treadmill.md) is an example of such our process that always balance itself out. This is different from [Allostasis](/notes/allostasis.md) which is about adjusting to a situation, rather than trying to cancel it's effects.

At the personal level, moderation means to seek out the [Harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md), to balance the different part of ourselves, to pursue our goals while not being fixated at the price of ignoring everything else or exhausting ourselves. To dream big yet remember our limitations.
