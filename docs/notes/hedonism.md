# Hedonism

## Notes

Hedonism is about letting [Desire](/notes/desire.md) guide our actions, that moral behavior is at the eye of the beholder, and good or bad only measures by how much pleasure or pain we gain. While some hedonistic might separate between different types of pleasures, that some are more "true" than others, or "worthwhile" pursuing, it is not always the case.

The appeal of hedonism that it is really easy to [Love what is good](/notes/love-what-is-good.md), because what is good is what we love, thus reversing the question on it's head, instead of us trying to enjoy doing the right thing, we assign "goodness" to what we feel is fun [Reverse Thinking](/notes/reverse-thinking.md).
