# Analysis Paralysis

## Notes

Analysis paralysis is when we are overwhelmed with information and can't make up our mind [Lost in the infinite](/notes/lost-in-the-infinite.md). The situation is too [complex](/notes/complexity.md) for us to handle, too many things to consider at once, and we can't [distill](/notes/distillment.md) them into a single decision rule.

Either we fail to decide because holding all the information in our mind is [too much](/notes/overloading.md) for us to handle [our brain is meant for processing](/notes/our-mind-is-a-processor-and-not-a-warehouse.md), or perhaps some decisions can't be resolved using rationality, and require a [Leap Into Faith](/notes/leap-into-faith.md)
