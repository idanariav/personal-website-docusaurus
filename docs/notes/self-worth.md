# Self Worth

## Notes

Self worth is being able to acknowledge your capabilities, but not over estimate them. it's the opposite of both [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md), and [Imposter Syndrome](/notes/imposter-syndrome.md). The first is because we vastly over estimate our capabilities to the point we neglect their development for the sake of our ego and appearance, while in the second we feel unworthy and judge ourselves poorly even when we are very capable. Although, self worth is more than just our capabilities, it's tied to our identity, our soul, our feeling of [Belonging](/notes/inclusion.md) in this world. When we feel that our skills are inadequate, we might still think we have worth, but when we feel that we as a person are useless, then we have no self worth.

Without self worth, we don't have [Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md) (and vice versa), and it is very likely that we will be unable to find [Balance](/notes/harmonious-self.md) because we keep on prioritizing other things instead of ourselves, or [criticizing](/notes/self-criticism.md) ourselves every time we make a mistake.

On the other hand, to be confident in one self is both the result and the cause of [trusting](/notes/trust.md) ourselves and acting without being limited by fear of judgment. By believing we have something to contribute, we act, which strengthens our self worth in return [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md).

When you feel confident in yourself, when you feel worthy of love, of happiness, that you can be useful somehow to someone, you become your own [Safe Base](/notes/safe-base.md). You have the energy to carry yourself forward, to overcome obstacles [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md).

Additionally, to discredit ourselves can often lead to [cynicism](/notes/cynicism.md), because if we don't value ourselves, perhaps we are quick to judge others as useless as well.
