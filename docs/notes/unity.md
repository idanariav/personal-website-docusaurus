# Unity

## Notes

We feel a sense of Unity when we truly connect or see ourselves as connected to others, we are in complete [sync](/notes/resonance.md) with them. Our desire to connect runs deep, and it is an [integral](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md) part of what it means to be human, our very identity is [shaped](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md) with others, our [happiness](/notes/happiness-is-shared.md) is through connecting to others. We are both with the [tools](/notes/empathy.md) to connect.

A feeling of unity allows us to overcome [Self Bias](/notes/self-bias.md), [Individualism](/notes/individualism.md), and promotes [Altruism](/notes/giving.md).

Sometimes this feeling is based on a shared identity, goal or circumstances, which can often lead to a feeling of [us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md).

A feeling of unity is not limited to people, it can also be for professions, for tasks or duties. When we are one with what we do, we experience [Flow](/notes/flow.md) and push away [Alienation](/notes/alienation.md)

The ultimate sense of unity comes when we both feel one with ourselves [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md), and one with others.
