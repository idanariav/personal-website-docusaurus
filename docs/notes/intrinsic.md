# Intrinsic

## Notes

Intrinsic is when we appreciate something for what it is, not for the [Utility](/notes/utility.md) it provides us. It is to see beyond the [form](/notes/form-vs-essence.md) and see it's essence.

For example, a person who loves to play the guitar doesn't asks himself "what do I get out of it?", they are not focus on future earnings or social status, they play the guitar because that's what gives them enjoyment [Happiness is contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md). Intrinsic desires are when something is a goal of itself, and not a means to a different goal [Instrumental](/notes/instrumental.md). Similarly, intrinsic viewpoint often cultivates [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md), because our goal and the method are aligned, we don't study to get a reward, we study because we enjoy studying.

There's a level of [Honesty](/notes/honesty.md) when we treat things based on their intrinsic rather than their instrumental values. We truly care about them, and won't discard them when a better alternative comes up. For example, managing a workplace through an intrinsic leans would lead to a [People First](/notes/people-first.md) attitude, as they recognize the contribution and holistic nature of each person, rather than just as machines for a job.
