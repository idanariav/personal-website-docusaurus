# Active Listening

## Notes

Active listening is as the name suggests, active. It requires a conscious effort from your part not only listen to what the other is saying, but also to try your best to understand, and react accordingly. This is a rather effortful task that demands a lot of Focus but the rewards are high, allowing for a much deeper conversation and connection, or simply knowing someone else better, compare to types of passive listening created by the Attention Economy.

Active listening could improve the chances of achieving Empathy, i.e creating reciprocity and Trust.

Usually to truly listen, we have to quiet our mind, to focus on the other instead of ourselves, and to delay our default tendency for problem solving and Judgment. You are not their to prove them right, to win the argument, or even to give them advice or teach them something Dont Jump to the Rescue. They don't What they need your attention and having an open mind and heart .

To be a good listener, first you have to be curious. Forget what you know or think you know. Avoid all Stereotypes. Focus on the person in front of you, act as if you know nothing about them (which usually you really don't). Then, to express your understanding, try to mirror their words. By talking like them, it shows them that you understand their viewpoint, even if you don't agree with it.
