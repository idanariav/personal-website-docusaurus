# Complexity

## Notes

Complexity is when an idea is hard to understand, or to implement [Simplicity](/notes/simplicity.md). Complexity is not necessarily a bad thing because complex systems can be highly beneficials because they allow the combination between multiple viewpoints [Synergy](/notes/win-win-situations.md), taking into account many variables and giving a nuanced result [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md).

A common issue with complexity is the increased complexity in human life. [Innovation](/notes/innovation.md), education and productivity require us to constantly improve, making it harder and harder as time goes by because of [Diminishing Returns](/notes/diminishing-returns.md). If 1000 years ago, just be being literate you could have been the most successful merchant, 100 years ago you needed to have basic math, and today you need computer skills, and soft skills, etc.
Sometimes it leads to the [red queen syndrome](/notes/red-queen-syndrome.md), that you need to run nonstop just to stay in the same place.

Complexity also drives us towards digital and shared solutions, both stem from the same assumption that today's lives are too complex to be done by one person and one [mind](/notes/extended-mind.md). Since [our mind is a processor and not a warehouse](/notes/our-mind-is-a-processor-and-not-a-warehouse.md), we can reduce complexity using todolists, checklists, habits and digital notetaking as a form of [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md), using these tools to think across time without rethinking each time from scratch.

Similarly, we can use others to solve shared problems [peer support](/notes/peer-support.md). For example, our economy is based on an assumption that each person focuses on what they do best [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md), because a single person can't be their own farmer, clothing maker, mechanic and driver. We need diversity of skills in order to meet the needs of advanced culture and to solve difficult [Problems](/notes/problems.md)
