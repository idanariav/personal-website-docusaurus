# Risk Management

## Notes

It is perhaps within our human nature that we tend to be more loss averse, meaning that we strongly prefer to not lose what we [have](/notes/attachment.md), than to gain something of (supposedly) similar value.

Risk management is also tied to our ability to [predict](/notes/prediction.md) the future and try to reduce [Randomness](/notes/randomness.md) and [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md). The more we fail to do that, the more risk averse we are.

Our dislike of risk runs deep. Facing great risks, we might experience [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md), where fear and stress [takes](/notes/system-1.md) hold of us and do what's possible to avoid that risk. Often risk avoidance can lead to a [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md), because without facing risks and [Challenges](/notes/struggle.md), we can't grow. We would be stuck in the [status quo](/notes/status-quo-bias.md) without any desire or hope for change. To live "safely" is to not live at all [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md)
