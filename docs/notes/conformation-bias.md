# Conformation Bias

## Notes

Conformation bias is when we implement a [double standard](/notes/agent-vs-society-moralism.md) between two bits of information depending on whether the information matches our existing beliefs or not.
If it does, we tend to accept it without any criticism or verification [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md), while information that goes against our beliefs is held to a more robust method of examination, or even ignoring immediately.

The more extreme version of conformation bias is when we only search for information that matches our beliefs in the first place, without listening to competing viewpoints [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md). Conformation bias creates a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md) of [Over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md) because if all the information we encounter says we are correct, then we must be very smart, forgetting the fact that it is us who chose to only check information that agrees with us.

Avoiding conformation bias is very difficult because we are lead astray by our own [Gut Feelings](/notes/heuristics.md), so how can we know that we are making a mistake? It takes [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md) and [Humility](/notes/humility.md) to successfully search and embrace knowledge that contradicts our beliefs, or even acknowledging that we could be wrong.

The best solution would be to practice [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md), to treat our beliefs as the belief of another, and approach knowledge of any kind with [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md)
