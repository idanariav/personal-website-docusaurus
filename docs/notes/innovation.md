# Innovation

## Notes

Innovation is perhaps the highest standard of creative thinking. It is to truly generate something new, something that has not existed before. As humanity progresses, being innovative has become more [complex](/notes/complexity.md) because all the low hanging fruits have already been taken.

We would have to use our [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md) to rise above the obvious and mediocre, to think differently from others [Conformism](/notes/social-environment.md), and search for the [Counterfactual](/notes/counterfactual.md), the idea that waits for us in the void, that doesn't exist yet, or that is around us yet haven't been combined into something coherent.

Perhaps it's no longer possible to be a sole innovator, one person can't hold all the necessary information to be truly innovative. More than being a genius, innovating is the product of good [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md).

Innovating is also not a "eureka" moment, it is the result of a long and difficult [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md) phase. It is the result of many [failures](/notes/failure.md), of many wrong ways just to find the correct one, and while it may not seem that way, every step along the way brought us [closer](/notes/effort-storing.md) to our success.

Since the simple tasks are being automized and outsourced to either A.I or low wage workers, the need to innovate has never been higher. Our [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md) will be based on our ability to innovate, to bring something new, our [Skill synthesis](/notes/skill-synthesis.md) to the world.

Same as with other forms of creativity, innovating requires a level of [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md), because creativity can't be commanded be achieved by external rewards.
