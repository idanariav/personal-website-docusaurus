# Anti-Fragility

## Notes

At the basic level, anti-fragility is a form of robustness, of the ability to withstand and resist external shocks, errors and randomness.

Anti-Fragility systems response well to [Randomness](/notes/randomness.md). Usually randomness can cause damage to a system, since most are built on [Optimization](/notes/optimization.md) that are counter productive to stability. However, smart system can expect that the worst will happen, so we need to be ready for it [Pre-Mortem](/notes/pre-mortem.md).

Ignoring or even worse trying to reduce randomness can make us ignore important information for our stability and growth, similar to how disabling the price system has toppled communist economies, or just imagine how evolution would look like without biological mutations. [Adaptability](/notes/adaptability.md) is key, it allows us to adjust to the world around us, to be at [flow](/notes/life-as-flow.md) with it, to accept it's [signals](/notes/resonance.md), to improve the way we operate within it, instead of trying to live in [wishful](/notes/manifesting.md) thinking. We can't [predict](/notes/prediction.md) the future, nor are we capable of [rational](/notes/rationalism.md) our way into building perfectly stable systems. For our benefit in the long run, lessons have to be learned, and it has to be the hard way.

Through [hardships](/notes/struggle.md) we learn and grow, and hardships usually comes in the form of [unexpected](/notes/uncertainty.md) challenges, or at least at a price, for example vaccinations and workouts both improve the body by making it suffer measured challenges [Allostasis](/notes/allostasis.md).

keynotes:
1. the bigger you are, usually you're more fragile
2. anti-fragility is not only the key to stability, but also to sustained growth
3. anti-fragility of the whole is usually built on the fragility of the parts [Creative Destruction](/notes/creative-destruction.md)
