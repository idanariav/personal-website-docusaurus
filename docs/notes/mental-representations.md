# Mental Representations

## Notes

Mental Representations are our way to efficiently store, search and find information in our [Human Brain](/notes/human-brain.md). Those are created by converting knowledge into visual representations. [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md). For example, the expertise of chess masters doesn't stem from analyzing more moves ahead than everyone else, but rather the have memorized more board configurations which connects to a certain series of moves. They will intuitively sense what is the correct move based on the board configuration [Intuition](/notes/intuition.md).
Therefore, knowledge and expertise is having more relevant mental representations, a set of [Heuristics](/notes/heuristics.md) and "cheat sheets", in your given field.
Additionally, they tested whether chess masters remember board configurations better. They did when it was a board layout that made sense, but not when it was a random order.
