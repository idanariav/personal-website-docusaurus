# Mental Representations

## Notes

Mental Representations are our way to efficiently store, search and find information in our Human Brain. Those are created by converting knowledge into visual representations. Effort Storing.

For example, the expertise of chess masters doesn't stem from analyzing more moves ahead than everyone else, but rather the have memorized more board configurations which connects to a certain series of moves. They will intuitively sense what is the correct move based on the board configuration Intuition.
Therefore, knowledge and expertise is having more relevant mental representations, a set of Heuristics and "cheat sheets", in your given field.

Additionally, they tested whether chess masters remember board configurations better. They did when it was a board layout that made sense, but not when it was a random order.

Similarly, envisioning yourself doing a task before actually doing it improves your performance, like a form of Simulations. Some preformers do these visualizations as a ritual every time before they begin.
