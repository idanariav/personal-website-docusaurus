# Change Starts from the inside out

## Notes

When you try to change yourself, don't start by focusing on your actions - like saying "I want to lose 5 pounds", but rather focus on the identity you want to adapt - "i want to be a healthy person".
Focusing on the identity provides the [motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md), the direction, and the longevity of a successful change, instead of actions which are short-sighted, lack the "why", and irrelevant once completed [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md) . Instead of forcing ourselves to act in a certain way, we rewrite our [life narrative](/notes/narratives.md) in a way that makes us [wish](/notes/love-what-is-good.md) to embrace that new lifestyle.

When we embrace a new identity, we allow ourselves to change across time [Intertemporal Identity](/notes/intertemporal-identity.md). We manage to implement our [Second order thinking](/notes/second-order-thinking.md) as a source for change. This is opposite to the idea of [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md), the idea that change, learning, and being, comes from experimentation and action, not self affirming statements.

The added benefit is that when we embrace a new identity rather than just changing our actions, we implement a [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md), we prove that not only we can act differently, we can become a different, better person. Also, claiming a new identity is like a [Fresh start](/notes/clean-slate.md), we are not limited by the actions, tendencies and behaviors of our "past self", rather we are now someone new who could adopt a new lifestyle without previous baggage.

However, embracing a new identity is not so easy. One can argue that even in the best case scenario, our identities are not replaced, rather [layered](/notes/layering.md) on top of another, so the range of potential identities that we can embrace is limited by who we were in the past.
