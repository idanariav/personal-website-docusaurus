# Wu Wei

## Notes

Wu wei means "no action", it means to be connected, responsive to the world around us, to not spend energy fighting back because it is useless. We can achieve much more by responding instead of [resisting](/notes/reactance.md).

When we are [one](/notes/unity.md) with nature, when we live the "Tao", we don't "do" anything, yet with this "non action" we achieve much. It's like a state of [flow](/notes/flow.md), a harmony with the universe. A rock doesn't "want" to fall, yet it does. A river doesn't try to carve the rock, and yet it does. When we free ourselves completely from our human desires and actions, we prosper. Like an artist that by not focusing has the best ideas, or how aikido manages to defeat their enemies by using their momentum against them. The [less](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md) they do (or the more they do nothing), the [better](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md) off they are.
