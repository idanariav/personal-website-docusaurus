# Helplessness

## Notes

Helplessness is when we don't feel any [control](/notes/agency.md) over our lives , we feel that [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md) have complete power over us, determining our fate. To make things worse, that fate is filled with [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) because the situation around us is ever [changing](/notes/life-is-change.md). We don't know what will happen, we might (and probably will) suffer, and there's nothing we can do about it. We live in constant [Fear](/notes/fear.md) of what future may bring.

We often get into a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md) where we feel like a victim, we don't believe in our [ability](/notes/will-to-power.md) to change the situation, which leads us to do [nothing](/notes/fixed-mindset.md), which in most cases worsen the situation. It's like wearing a blindfold, only capable of seeing darkness everywhere [Optimism](/notes/optimism.md), a sign of [despair](/notes/depression.md).

In cases of helplessness, we seek what little control and certainty we can provide for ourselves, which is often a form of [Escapism](/notes/escapism.md), to escape to a different world where things are better, even if they are fake. For example video games, drinking, tv, etc.
