# The Law of Reverse Effect

## Notes

When we focus on the results, we won't achieve them. Instead, we have to focus on the [experience](/notes/flow.md) of our actions, or better yet - let go of trying to be an observer, just be present. This concept is an embodiment [Wu wei](/notes/wu-wei.md) or "the way" of [Eastern Philosophy](/notes/eastern-philosophy-philosopher.md).

For example, we get stressed out in tests because we really want to succeed. Therefore, it is not a surprise that it's more likely that we will preform worse compared to our training because instead of giving our complete [focus](/notes/focus.md) to what we are trying to accomplish, we are too focused on what ifs, thinking about the future [forward thinking](/notes/forward-thinking.md), about what we are trying to achieve, that we have little left for the actual test. We are both [distracted](/notes/procrastination.md) and [stressed](/notes/stress.md).

We can't overpower our mind, to think that we can set goals yet not focus on them. To try and control your mind is usually an attempt doomed from the start, [mental control paradox](/notes/mental-control-paradox.md), like trying not to think about an elephant, the mind does as it is programmed to, it is not listening to us.

Setting [goals](/notes/lifes-mission.md) takes away our focus from where it should be, which is the life we live right now, the way we behave right now, the present is what matters. We need to [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), and the results will flow by themselves. A person who focused on doing a good job will be rewarded and promoted much more than those who only care about the promotion.

This law is also true on the reverse - **somethings are only achieved by their opposites**
When it comes to fields of creativity, not only that by trying to "force" creativity out of us we will likely only have a stronger writer's block, it is also essential to let our mind rest in order for creativity to be generated. [Diffuse mode](/notes/downtime-brain.md)

By being [vulnerable](/notes/vulnerability.md) we show power, by letting go we allow others to be closer to us. Democracies give up on control to have a stronger government, by being not extremist in your beliefs, you are representing a more true version of those beliefs.

The more "true" you are trying to be by a certain ideology or belief, or in more simple terms, the more "extreme" you are, not only that you are affecting your chances to be understood and come to an agreement with the other side, you are even more destructive to your own belief!

For example, a person who is deeply patriotic will want to do everything in order to protect his nation and his fellow citizens. At first, it will perhaps start with tougher measures towards immigrants, then perhaps criminals, then those who appose him politically, and lastly all those who are not "willing to do what it takes" in order to protect the nation.
But if all those people are his enemies, who is left of his nation? who is he trying to protect?
By being extremist, not only he hurt people, but also he failed to fulfill his own purpose.
