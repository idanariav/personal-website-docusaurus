# Functionalism 

## Notes

People, social movements, and society in general, can all be seen as a collection of "machines" with a function or a goal to produce something, a certain type of result or effect [A person is a community](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md).
The output of a complex machine, whether it is the individual or a social movement, is based on the interaction between those parts [Emergence](/notes/emergence.md). For example a bike has a certain function, but its use is going to vary based on whether it is used by a worker on its way to work, a talented performer, or even as a tool to harm others. Similarly we can identify the contribution of each such machine within an organization, or a person, that together form the actions.
That inner desire for each machine to actualize itself is similar to the [will to power](/notes/will-to-power.md)
