# Start Small

## Notes

start small means that change is more likely to occur when we being with small actions rather than life changing decisions. Whether its to start a new business, diet, exercise regime, or working on a personal project.

First we must be sure we are moving in the right direction, before we run at full speed.

For example, writing for just 15 minutes a day means 7.5 hours a month! Imagine what you can do with a free full day of work each month. It represents a belief that we can [grow](/notes/growth-mindset.md), one small step at a time.
