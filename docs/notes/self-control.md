# Self-control

## Notes

Self control is perhaps a contradiction of a sort, but in essence it means that you are capable of [Agency](/notes/agency.md) in your live, that you manage to overcome internal desires, emotions and intrusive thoughts in order to fulfill your "true" preferences. For example, to [Delay Gratification](/notes/patience.md), resist [Temptations](/notes/procrastination.md), or obey [Rigid rules](/notes/rigid-rules.md) are simple examples of self control.

We might imagine self control as the victory of our [Rational System](/notes/system-2.md) over our [Emotional Side](/notes/system-1.md), yet it is far from the truth. Emotions are not something to be discarded, they can be [helpful](/notes/emotional-aikido.md) as much as our rational side, and similarly our rational side can lead us [astray](/notes/rationalization.md) just the same.

Paradoxically, self control can also be a sign of [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), if you feel that "yourself" is something that you have to control, that there is a "controlling" side and a "controlled" side, this means that you perhaps lack clarity about who you are, or that you fail to listen to the different parts of yourself and achieve [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md).

Perhaps self control is a too simplistic of a way of looking and analyzing our behavior. The best case scenario, I believe, is to not need self control in the first place. To [create](/notes/nudge.md) an environment that reflects who we want to be, and makes it easier for us to follow through, without the need to exert our [limited willpower](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md)
