# Positive Language

## Notes

Positive language means using words, phrases and tones that are meant to support, and empower [self worth](/notes/self-worth.md).

These are words that focus on [agency](/notes/agency.md), filled with [Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md), and clear of [Blame](/notes/blame.md) or [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md)

Instead of being our own (or others') [critics](/notes/self-criticism.md), we can use language as a tool for connection, for empowering [self talk](/notes/self-talk.md). We know that [Framing](/notes/framing.md) is a powerful tool, so by changing how we describe something, we change how we experience and think about it.
