# Inclusion

## Notes

To be inclusive is more than just to allow someone to take part in you are doing, but rather being [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md) about it. It is to believe in others and in their capabilities to be a contributing member of your, "i.e" our group. This essentially is an empowering move. By [trusting](/notes/trust.md) others we allow them to fulfill their potential, both giving them a sense of accomplishment [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md), but also helping yourself along the way [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md). It requires [Humility](/notes/humility.md) to accept that you don't always know best, or that you might need the help of others. By letting them take part, we help ourselves.

For example, for parent's inclusion could be the change in perspective from "I have to do every for our child" or "I have to keep them busy while I do things" to "how can I help them help me". This can even be something as small as asking the kid to raise their hips while you are replacing a dipper, or teaching them how to cook and clean while you do those chores. They want to help you [People are inherently good](/notes/humans-are-good-as-default.md), they just don't know how. By slowly developing their skills and letting them be a part of it, they could become much more independent and yet helpful people. They will have a much stronger sense of [Self Worth](/notes/self-worth.md)
