# Problems

## Notes

We can divide problems based on their level of [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md)
1. **Simple** - usually comes with basic instructions, that after several times you have enough experience to do them easily and automatically, like baking a cake. [Habit formation](/notes/habit-formation.md)
2. **Hard** - like flying a missile to space, it requires a lot of knowledge, cooperation and timing from many people, but usually once you crack the task, its easier to implement the next time.
3. **Complicated** - similar to hard, but succeeding once doesn't make it (completely) easier the next time, like raising a child. Surely there are some best practices, but you can't replicate the process and get the same result.
