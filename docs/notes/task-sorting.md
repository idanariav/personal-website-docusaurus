# Task Sorting

## Notes

every task should be divided into one of four categories in order to find the best solution to solving it

How to sort a task:
1. *Delete* - is the task even worth doing? is it beneficial or important? otherwise - delete it,
2. *Delay* - is it important to do it now? also - consider the "2 minute rule". else, delay it [the 2 minute rule](/notes/the-2-minute-rule.md)
3. *Delegate* - is it worth your time? imagine you evaluate your time as an hourly rate of income. does this task justifies this cost? otherwise, try to delegate it to a person (for exp - finding someone to fix a leak in the house, repair the car...). also, another possibility is to delegate it to an automation process. try to see if this recurring task can be partially done by a software/code/tool you set-up
4. *Do* - if all else fails, just do the task
