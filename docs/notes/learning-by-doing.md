# Learning by Doing

## Notes

While [Mastery](/notes/mastery.md) usually involves both theoretical knowledge and [hands on knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md), we learn much more when we [engage](/notes/engagement.md) with the material. Engaging means to switch from a passive mode of learning such as hearing a lecture or reading a book to a more [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md) version such as creating or [teaching](/notes/feynman-technique.md).

Most of us avoid learning by doing because it:
1. **Damages our ego** - switching from consuming to generating knowledge can have an awakening experience, one that shows us the gaps in our knowledge. [Ego](/notes/form-vs-essence.md)
2. **causes us to fail** - When we only consume content, we can be safe from [Failure](/notes/failure.md) because we never try, while being proactive forces us to try and ultimately fail, most likely on the [very first try](/notes/first-batch-trash.md)
3. **Hard** - listening to a podcast is easy, writing one is hard. Even when we know that [learning should be hard](/notes/learning-should-be-hard.md), it is still a natural tendency to avoid hardships when possible.

There's no escaping the truth that [practice beats perfection](/notes/practice-beats-perfection.md). The only way to improve is by doing, so we have to get rid of any false idols of [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md), embrace our imperfect knowledge, and just start [practicing](/notes/deliberate-practice.md).
