# Allostasis

## Notes

Allostasis is the ability to maintain balance while constantly progressing. It's a form of [resilence](/notes/anti-fragility.md), like how a muscle gets stronger after a workout. The reason that it gets stronger is because the body wants to maintain it's ability to withstand hardships, so if the challenges become harder, the body has to grow accordingly.

This is contrary to [Homeostasis](/notes/balance-extremes.md) that tries to maintain an equal, identical level no matter what. Like body temperature that tries to remain stable no matter the degrees outside. Allostasis is the embodiment of [Adaptability](/notes/adaptability.md), to best prepare ourselves to the [Context](/notes/context.md) we are in.

With allostasis, there is no "steady state", it is order based on constant chaos, it's to constantly be moving and adapting [To be is to be incomplete](/notes/to-be-is-to-be-incomplete.md)
