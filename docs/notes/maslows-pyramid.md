# Maslow's Pyramid

## Notes
According to Maslow, humans have several different hierarchical levels of aspirations, it starts from simple physical needs, and builds up towards self actualisation. Technically, you can't reach a higher step before having a safe base under it. For example, you won't search (or find) meaning without first having food in your belly and a roof above your head.

However, while it is not impossible to achieve a higher level before completing the level under it, it is usually very hard and uncommon, and most people would prefer to have the lower goals before "moving up".

This essentially shows how we are both [objects](/notes/objectivity.md) that have basic physical needs, but also [subjects](/notes/subjectivity.md) that have desires, [goals](/notes/lifes-mission.md) and dreams of self actualization. From the most basic needs of [Nutrition](/notes/nutrition.md) and [Sleep](/notes/sleep.md), to feelings of [Psychological safety](/notes/psychological-safety.md), of [Belonging](/notes/inclusion.md) and finally to [transcendence](/notes/transcendence.md).

A common theme is that we search for [Stability](/notes/stability.md), to know that we don't have to fear that tomorrow we might lose either our sources of physical needs, or even our friends and loved ones. Another theme is that we are [social beings](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md), we desperately need to connect and be seen by others.
