# Subjective Reality

## Notes

Subjective reality means that between us and the world around us there's a veil that prevents us from seeing the external world as it is [Objectivism](/notes/objectivism.md) and instead we see a "translated"/distorted version of it. For example, the phrase "looking at the world through rose colored glasses" is a perfect example for a subjective reality. The concept of what is true is mixed with our own perception [contextualism](/notes/contextualism.md).

Basically, every time that we assume something that is not a natural part of the external world, like causality, peoples thoughts and motives, every time we project our inner [narratives](/notes/narratives.md), [thoughts](/notes/judgment.md) or [emotions](/notes/emotional-projection.md) onto the world, that's where our subjective reality diverges the most from the actual reality.

There is tremendous variation in our internal concepts of reality itself. While we think that words are enough, that when you and I say "tree" we both mean the same thing, but due to the variations in our experiences, levels of expertise, cultural influence, and so it, the likelihood is that **even if we share the same language, the likelihood that you and I imagine the same thing is extremely low.**

**Some words have more variations than others, but no word is without a lot of variation** [Semantics of words](/notes/semantics-of-words.md). Which means that the more complex the idea that we are trying to communicate, the less likely that we will be able to do so properly. It is more likely that people will try to use their own [Mental Shortcuts](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md) to fill the gaps in our message which might change how the idea is perceived.

As a population of people, we have a lot of [Range](/notes/breath-beats-depth.md) in terms of what we know, which is a strength. The variability in our knowledge and concepts is a feature, not a bug. [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md). *this reminds me of* [Post-Modernism](/notes/post-modernism.md), *where it was mentioned that the diversity is a feature of human society, and not a drawback*
