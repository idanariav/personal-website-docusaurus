# Placebo Effect

## Notes

The Placebo effect is when simply believing that something will have a certain effect on us, it actually does. It is a more subconscious level than [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md). It originated from medicine, where test subjects received a fake pill that was said to heal them, and the surprising result was that some of them actually improved despite not getting any treatment. This shows the power of our minds on our bodies [Mind-body connection](/notes/mind-body-connection.md) and the power of [Perception](/notes/subjective-reality.md).
