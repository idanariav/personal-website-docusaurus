# Theory of Mind

## Notes

InÂ psychology,Â **theory of mind**Â refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribingÂ mental statesÂ to them (that is,Â assumingÂ what is happening in theirÂ mind). This includes the knowledge that others'Â beliefs, desires, intensions, emotions, andÂ thoughtsÂ may be different from one's own. [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md)

A theory of mind is a theory because we can't read other's mind, so we can only assume what is happening in other people's mind based on their actions and appearance [Signaling](/notes/signaling.md) [Behavioralism](/notes/behavioralism.md). We don't have access to internal thoughts, feelings or sensations others experience. It is a question whether such thing is possible without directly being that person [the hard problem of consciousness](/notes/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness.md), because maybe even asking or exploring his mind biologically is not enough. Some experiences are perhaps untranslatable [experience knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md).

Not only that we don't have access to the other's mind, we are also "intorrupted" by our own. It is very hard for us to avoid the [Curse of Knowledge](/notes/curse-of-knowledge.md), escape how we see the world, and putting ourselves in some else's mind. We mistakenly assume that we are the same, ignoring the vast [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md) in ways of thinking.

Therefore, the question is how do we form an understanding between people? the most direct solution is language. Although we each of us is different, it seems that we can agree on rules and structure to facilitate meaning between us using words, although even language has it's limitations [Semantics of words](/notes/semantics-of-words.md).

Perhaps language is too rational and rigid solution. Perhaps true understanding can only come from a sense of [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md), generated during a moment of connection, facilitated by [non verbal communication](/notes/non-verbal-communication.md) more than words.
