# Future Disillusionment

## Notes

Future disillusionment is when we imagine that we will "be happy when x", when we depend our happiness on an external status of the future, like reaching a goal or gaining status, wealth or property that will "finally" grant us happiness, only to discover that we are no more happier (or even worse) than we have previously been [Disappointment](/notes/disappointment.md). It can lead to [Depression](/notes/depression.md) and [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md) because we can chase our entire lives a dream that would be empty and pointless, and we would have been better off if we stayed exactly where we are. We set our [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) way too high, which causes us to crash when we fail to reach them.

Either because we already have a new goal to reach [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), or that we are not mindful of the good that we already have [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md) [Happiness is an internal state](/notes/happiness-is-an-internal-state.md) [Happiness is contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md) [Gratitude](/notes/gratitude.md).

The reverse of "I'll be happy when" is "I was happy when" [Nostalgia](/notes/nostalgia.md). We fool ourselves to think that we were so happy in the past simply because we choose to forget all the problems and focus only on the positive, even if at that moment we weren't as happy as we claim now to have been.
