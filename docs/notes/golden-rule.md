# Golden Rule

## Notes

The famous golden rule is "Treat others the way you want to be treated by them". It is meant to encourage Reciprocity and Kindness. To not look at life as a Zero sum game, but rather as a chance to pay it forward, with the hope that people will respond in kindness as well.

It reminds of the Categorical imperative, because we need to step back of this specific situation, and see it from a more general point of view, and treat others in a gentler, kinder way even if they "dont deserve it", because this is how you would have liked to be treated.

The absurdity is that we often treat others better than we treat ourselves. We are our worst critic, we talk negatively about ourselves in ways we would never talk to a friend. In these cases, it's actually the reverse golden rule that should be applied, that we will treat ourselves with Self-compassion, the way others treat us.

It also subtly assumes a lack of Diversity, that what we want is the same as what others want and vice versa, but what if I don't like the way I'm being treated, even though it is exactly how they wish to be treated themselves?
