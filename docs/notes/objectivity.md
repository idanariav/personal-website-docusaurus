# Objectivity

## Notes

Objectivity means to become and to be viewed as an object. It is to lose all [Intrinsic](/notes/intrinsic.md) value and only be seen through the [Instrumental](/notes/instrumental.md) value. It is the focus on the "concrete natural facts". For example, to focus on a person's indisputable, often quantitative aspects such as their age, height, sex, ethnicity, IQ, etc, as opposed to looking at the qualitative, relative aspects of his life such as dreams, values, etc... [Subjectivity](/notes/subjectivity.md). Often it is connected with the process of [Commodification](/notes/commodification.md), that we are seen as products or tools to be used, rather than as people. Similarly, when we [dedicate](/notes/lost-in-the-finite.md) ourselves completely for a cause, "forgetting ourselves", or becoming a member of a [herd](/notes/social-environment.md), we become an object to be used for a "greater process", at the potential cost of self destruction.

Often, to be an object, or to be viewed as one, is the same process of [dehumanization](/notes/dehumanization.md), to have lower [Moral worth](/notes/moral-worth.md) or responsibility, down to the level of an animal or an inanimate object. This can also be self inflicted. Often people with [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md) treat themselves as an object, not necessarily in terms of low [Self Worth](/notes/self-worth.md), but by thinking that they can't change, they treat themselves as something fixed, immutable. It is to turn ourselves into [one-dimensional being](/notes/one-dimensional-being.md), to see ourselves as just one thing, permanent and [unchanging](/notes/adaptability.md).

Therefore, an object, is also something that is fixed, unchanging, again like a rock that will forever be the same.
