# Love what is Good

## Notes

In order for us to be a moral, successful person, we have to to understand that [Willpower is Limited](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md), we can't force it upon ourselves to improve or to act well. Virtue relies on being in harmony with oneself [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md), instead of an [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md) where we try to force ourselves to act in a certain way.

By teaching ourselves to enjoy the right things, such as enjoying a workout, eating healthy, helping others, only then could we successfully change. We have to embrace an identity that enjoys doing those things [change starts from the inside out](/notes/change-starts-from-the-inside-out.md). This is one of the cornerstones in having a [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md).

But can we really love doing good things, should it even be enjoyable? What if doing the right thing is a "chore", a hassle? For [Immanuel Kant](/notes/immanuel-kant-philosopher.md), the right reason for doing something is because it is one's duty, not because one enjoys it. For [Aristotle](/notes/aristotle-philosopher.md), virtue is based on habituation.

According to Aristotle, we should fear the man that is doing the right thing out of an act of duty or self control rather then habits and enjoyment, because our willpower is limited. **If you true desires don't match the right actions, then one day you will fail** [Intention](/notes/intention.md). The person who helps the old lady cross the street because of a sense of duty rather than enjoyment will one day be too tired for that and he will stop acting this way.
