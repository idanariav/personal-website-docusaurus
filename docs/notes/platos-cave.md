# Plato's Cave

## Notes

Each object, whether real or imaginary (both "dogs" and "justice") are only representations of a flawless essence which exists in the world of ideals/forms. So there is a "perfect dogness", which all dogs are partial, imperfect imitations, like [Python classes](/notes/python-classes.md). That's why we can associate all dogs to the same species although the differences since we can detect that "perfect dogness" within them.
Most people are focusing on the representations, forgetting the ideals.  
the allegory of Plato's cave, we confuse the [representations](/notes/shallow-copy.md) with the actual ideals behind them. [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md) The process of philosophy is to wake our "mental senses", and see the true light instead of the reflections, to free ourselves from the cave, a process that will be both hard and confusing. Only through exercising our rationality can we ignore our senses and see the actual ideals.  [Idealism](/notes/idealism.md) [Truth](/notes/truth.md)
