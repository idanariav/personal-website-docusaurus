# Rigid rules

## Notes

when impose on ourselves a rule with a type of [ultimatum](/notes/binary-thinking.md) like "never" or "always", something that is always in effect no matter the [Context](/notes/context.md). An example could be "I never watch tv". The advantage of a rigid rule is that it's easier cognitively to maintain than "I rarely watch tv" because the [Flexability](/notes/adaptability.md) allows us to make [excuses](/notes/rationalization.md) why "just this time" it's okay to break it. 

The downside of rigid rules is that once broken, they usually lead to the [F-it effect](/notes/f-it-effect.md) effect. The same force that motivates us to maintain the rule - the [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md) of not breaking the chain is also it's downfall. Once a chain has been broken, it can't be restored. If you lost a streak of 2000 days on Duolingo, there's little chance that you'll have the motivation to continue studying as if nothing has happened. 

As time passes, our motivation shifts from [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) (the reason we set up the rule) to [External Motivation](/notes/external-motivation.md) (maintaining the streak), which is problematic on it's own, even if the rule is maintained.
