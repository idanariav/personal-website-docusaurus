# Lost in the Infinite

## Notes

To be lost in the infinite means that we cannot face the [Absurdity of existence](/notes/absurdity-of-existence.md). We face so many different options to the meaning of life and we unwillingly surrender to [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) and become [helpless](/notes/helplessness.md).

Not knowing which option is correct, we fail to act [Analysis paralysis](/notes/analysis-paralysis.md). Similar to [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md), we feel as if the answer of what is the correct choice has to be so clear, obvious and strong, that if we fail to feel in such a way than we either need more time to make a decision, or we failed to find the right option yet. We remain in a state of constant confusion and [FOMO](/notes/fomo.md), as if every new opportunity can be "our thing".

With time, being lost in the infinite can lead to [Nihilism](/notes/nihilism.md) if we eventually decide to give up the pursuit after the right answer or decide that it is pointless.

The only way to escape being lost is to make a [Leap Into Faith](/notes/leap-into-faith.md). Being lost is somewhat rejecting the notion that [Meaning is Crafted](/notes/meaning-is-crafted.md), that the value of a certain way of life, a certain identity isn't fixed and can be found out there. It is our responsibility to pour meaning into our life and make a choice to do something that matters to us.
