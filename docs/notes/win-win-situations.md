# Win Win Situations

## Notes

as opposed to [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md), win win situations are all about the "yes, and". To find the common ground between different parties, and see how our interests [align](/notes/cooperation.md). This often requires [Active Listening](/notes/active-listening.md), because finding the common ground is not always an easy task, we first have to truly understand the other side [Negotiation is an act of connection](/notes/negotiation-is-an-act-of-connection.md). A good way to do that is to use [Open ended questions](/notes/open-ended-questions.md)

Usually this perspective demands of us to see the other as a partner, a colleague that will help us solve this shared problem, rather than as an opposing side. Always remember when communicating that the other said is not the problem, the problem is the problem[people are not the problem](/notes/people-are-not-the-problem.md). Once we work together instead of against each other, we become much more capable at solving the problem at hand, while creating a better solution for both sides.

Working with someone, instead of against someone, reduces greatly the chance of [Reactance](/notes/reactance.md), because you are no longer their enemy, rather someone who wants to help them (and receive help from them). It creates a [Resonance](/notes/resonance.md) between you, one that makes communication and problem solving much easier.

In general, being [kind](/notes/giving.md), even if you have to take the first step, is a good way of creating a [Positive feedback loop](/notes/ripple-effect.md) that will eventually lead to a win win situation. For example, by being kind we might give up on something small for us that is very important for them, which might encourage them to do the same.
