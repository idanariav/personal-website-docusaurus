## Notes

"Safe Base" means to have somewhere or [someone](/notes/relationships.md) where we feel belong to. A place of support, of [Psychological safety](/notes/psychological-safety.md), a place to [recharge](/notes/rest.md), build up [Reserves](/notes/reserves.md) and to let go of life's worries [Stress](/notes/stress.md).

A safe place is where we feel [validated](/notes/validation.md), we feel seen, understood. We don't have to pretend, or to hide our "ugly" parts, we can just [be](/notes/authenticity.md) ourselves. We can be [vulnerable](/notes/vulnerability.md). We [Trust](/notes/trust.md) those around us, we know that they desire our wellbeing, and would always be there for us.

Having a safe base allows us to [venture](/notes/standing-up-for-yourself.md) out into the world, knowing we always have a place to go to if things get worse.
