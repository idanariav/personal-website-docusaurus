# Competition

## Notes

Competition is when each person tries to gain something at the expense of another [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md). This results from a [Zero sum](/notes/binary-thinking.md) thinking, that either I get something or they do, but not both. This is the core logic behind [Capitalism](/notes/capitalism.md), because allegedly competition brings the best of us, it forces us to improve, to focus on our [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md), which results in a richer (in terms of purchasing power and alternatives) economy.
