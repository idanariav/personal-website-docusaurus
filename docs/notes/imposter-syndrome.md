# Imposter Syndrome

## Notes

Imposter syndrome is when we feel that we are not entitled to our position in our current job, or status in life. We feel that we have cheated or imitated our way into success when we don't deserve it [self worth](/notes/self-worth.md). Usually it is when we believe that our knowledge is not sufficient to be an expert in this field, no matter how much we study [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md). We become our own worse [critic](/notes/self-criticism.md)

Perhaps we have over doubted ourselves in order to avoid [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md), only to end up on the other side of the spectrum. With imposter syndrome - [Moderation](/notes/balance-extremes.md) is the only path forward. To recognize our flaws and failures, yet not let them paralyze us, believing that we have worth as we are today, and also that we can improve.

How to avoid imposter syndrome:
1. **Be open for compliments** - Don't just listen to the negative things others say, also listen to the good things. Sometimes others have better grasp of our situation and skills. [peer support](/notes/peer-support.md)
2. **"Just" decide to believe** - Sometimes the only way out is through. Take a [Leap Into Faith](/notes/leap-into-faith.md), believing that you are capable "despite all evidence to the contrary"
3. **Add a "yet"** - even if you still believe that you are not capable enough, have confidence in your path forward knowing that you are capable of growing [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md), and that mastery is a [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md) kind of thing. Say "I am not good enough at this... yet". With time, your perceptive will catch up to your skills.
4. **Practice self compassion** - To quiet down our inner critic (which is too loud), practice ;[Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md). Recognize that this critic only tries to help us be better, but as a "one track mind voice", it lacks the broader perspective of who we are, and self compassion will help complete the picture, acknowledging the achievements we have made, and the effort we have and do put in.
