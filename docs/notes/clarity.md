# Clarity

## Notes

Clarity can sometimes be synonymous with [Simplicity](/notes/simplicity.md), but that is not necessarily the case. A very complex idea can be clear if presented in the right way.
Clarity could be considered as the opposite of [Ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md). When our [inner world](/notes/self-awareness.md) has clarity, that means that we are aware of our ideas, thoughts, beliefs and core values.
In essence, clarity is usually what we search for in our lives, because without clarity there can be no meaning, progress or knowledge [free will is knowledge](/notes/free-will-is-knowledge.md).

To achieve clarity:
1. **Name it** - Aspects of our lives are much easier to understand once we give the phenomenon a name, for example "I'm experiencing sadness" [Naming](/notes/naming.md)
2. **Be explicit** - When we convert desires or goals from abstract ideas to concrete examples, we gain clarity which makes these goals much more tangible and easier to follow [Planning](/notes/planning.md). For example, instead of "I want to be fit", say "I want to work out Monday-Wednesday for 30 minutes at 7am at our house"
3. **Step back** - Sometimes it's hard to see the forest for the trees, we are so [Entrenched](/notes/attachment.md) in what we do that it's hard to see clearly what is really happening. Therefore we need to take a moment and [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md), to view the situation as an external observer and see things more clearly.
4. **Make it small** - When concepts are mixed together, it is hard to notice when one ends and the other begins. Imagine going through a note without a title, outline, and when the writer jumps quickly from one example to another. When we [distill](/notes/distillment.md) and [separate](/notes/atomism.md) ideas into their core essence, they become much easier to understand.
