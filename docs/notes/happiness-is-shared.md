# Happiness is Shared

## Notes

Can we happy by ourselves? it seems like [Loneliness](/notes/loneliness.md) is one of the worst things that can happen to us. We know that [Human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md), we are born to connect with others, to share, our identity is highly influenced by others, if not completely determined by them [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md).

Therefore, it would come as no surprise that to be happy means that we are in the presence of others, whether from a shared activity, or even sharing a personal experience with others [Giving](/notes/giving.md).

There's something troubling about saying that our happiness ;[depends](/notes/dependency.md) on others. We want to believe that [Happiness is an internal state](/notes/happiness-is-an-internal-state.md), that it is something within our control (to an extent), yet to claim that we can only be happy with others seems to remove some of our power.

However, I believe it connects deeply to who we are. It is a dependency as much as it is a source of strength. Since we are social creatures, sometimes the community is the smallest unit which makes sense to examine. We are not alone in this world, and much of our desires and lifestyle are the result of our interaction with others. The happiness we get from our interaction with others is perhaps the deepest sense of happiness, it is a feeling of [Belonging](/notes/inclusion.md) in this world, of having a [Safe Base](/notes/safe-base.md) in our [Relationships](/notes/relationships.md).

We connect our happiness with others, since in the most fundamental aspect, we by default [empathize](/notes/empathy.md) with others, as we share their pain, we also share their happiness.
