# Attention Economy

## Notes

the attention economy is all the sources that try to monopolize and monetize our attention, for example media networks, social media, etc. Since usually these sources are free to use, that means that we are the product. The goal of the content is no longer to educate or inform, but rather tempt us to click and engage, to stir our emotions, everything that can be done in order to increase our odds of being attracted by advertisement. This has great implications on our ability to Focus, because they are the strongest Distractions that exists, and not even a beneficial one, but rather just a collection of Noise.

The strength of the social network is amplified by our need to connect Human is a social being, it is more than just a website, it is a place for social gathering, and when we don't give it our complete attention, we feel FOMO, as if we are missing out life itself. We fall pry to External Influence. Remember that they don't have your best interest at heart.

When it comes to social media, the solution is less is more. The less we use it, the better off we will be. Because whichever value these places try to sell us, it usually has the reverse effect. It makes us less connected to others, less happy, less engaged with life Depression.
