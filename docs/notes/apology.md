# Apology

## Notes

Apologizing is harder to do when we are stuck in [Cognitive Alignment](/notes/cognitive-alignment.md) , believing we can't error, or that to admit mistake is damaging to our core identity. [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md) makes it easier, when we grow from our mistake and we are no longer the one who errored.

Often an apology should come with an intent to "repair". Not only to ask for forgiveness but to act in a way to restore [Trust](/notes/trust.md) in the relationship. In can be to fix what has been broken, to dedicate time and energy to build something together, or work on a solution.
