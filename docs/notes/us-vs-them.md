# Us Vs Them

## Notes
The "us vs them" divide is when people not only naturally divide into groups, but also develop negative thoughts and feelings towards the other group.
Such divide could be arbitrary, and starts as early as childhood [Path Dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md), but whichever the source of the divide may be, once groups are formed, there is low tolerance for [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md) within each group, and [conformity](/notes/social-environment.md) becomes essential. Often the perceptions of the group are self reinforcing, because each member is [grown](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md) to hate the other group and love their own, which affects how they later educate their children .
On the one hand, there are good implications to this divide, such as increased [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md), [Kindness](/notes/giving.md), and "other-thinking". On the other hand, it increases the distance between groups, creates social gaps and even promotes hate and violence [Inequality](/notes/inequality.md).
In an us vs them mentality, the interaction with the other party are less about [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md) and more like a [Zero sum](/notes/binary-thinking.md) game. Similarly, this is much less [Deliberation](/notes/deliberation.md) between groups and more [Debate](/notes/debate.md).
