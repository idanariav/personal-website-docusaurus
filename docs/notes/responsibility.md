# Responsibility

## Notes

Responsibility is an act of [Unity](/notes/unity.md), we connect ourselves with something else, whether a person, a goal, a task, and see it as part of who we are. Taking care of it means taking care of us, although the connection can be [Instrumental](/notes/instrumental.md). We don't always choose what we are responsible for, nor do we always feel emotional connection to it, yet we still feel that it is in our best interest to take care of it.

Giving us responsibility over things pushes away [Alienation](/notes/alienation.md), we feel more connected to the world, because we now have a role to fill, something to take care of, and not just ourselves, it is our anchor to reality, to others.

When we assume responsibility over the events of our lives, we can finally switch our perception from [Life Denying](/notes/helplessness.md) to [Life Embracing](/notes/will-to-power.md), to take [Ownership](/notes/ownership.md) over it. Meaning, that being alive is a matter of connecting yourself in ever growing circles to what happens to you, the people you encounter, the world you live in.

Responsibility is primarily about being [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md), about doing what we can for the betterment of what we are responsible for, to practice our [Agency](/notes/agency.md) in making good decisions not just for ourselves but for others. While being responsible usually means being [accountable](/notes/accountability.md) for your mistakes, it doesn't mean that you focus on [Blame](/notes/blame.md) not does it mean it we can [control](/notes/acceptance.md) all that's happening. We shouldn't care about punishments, only on what can we do right now to fix it.
