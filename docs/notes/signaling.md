# Signaling

## Notes

**Signaling is when we focus on presenting a quality or an attribute to the outside world, whether we truly have it or not.**
For example, some claim that having a degree is essentially a very expensive signaling device, meaning that it is not the [content](/notes/intrinsic.md) of the degree that makes you desirable, but rather the fact that you were accepted to that institute, and had the perseverance to finish the degree. The degree usually serves you so much as it helps you [shine](/notes/instrumental.md) brighter than others, with no actual personal gain. It serves as a convenient [shortcut](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md) - people don't have to spend a lot of time getting to know us in order to know which qualities/values we have, it makes it easier for people to understand who we are.

Many animals use signaling, such as the peacock's tail, or horns, are not intrinsically useful, but rather a proof that the individual is healthy, strong, capable.
Signaling can also be deceiving, if for example we use all of our money to buy expensive clothing such that it would look as if we are rich, when in fact we are deeply poor.
In that case, there is a difference between who we truly are, and who we present ourselves as [Image vs core](/notes/form-vs-essence.md). That is why often signaling is an [taxing](/notes/struggle.md) move, because if it was easy it was devoid of value, like posting "I care about the environment", doing so rarely improves our status in comparison with being an environmental activist. [to be moral is to act moral](/notes/to-be-moral-is-to-act-moral.md). Only by paying a heavy price, we can make a [trustworthy](/notes/trust.md) message.

Signaling matters only because we are a [social](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md) animal, and we care about our [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md), our status and how we are perceived by others. Signaling therefore can also have a positive side, because the same desire to "fit it" can make us want to embrace positive behaviors [Ripple effect](/notes/ripple-effect.md).
