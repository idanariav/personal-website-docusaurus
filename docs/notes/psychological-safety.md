# Psychological Safety

## Notes

Psychological safety is the commonplace acceptance (usually in a workplace) that a person can express opinions and ideas without getting punished for saying them [Freedom of speech](/notes/freedom-of-speech.md). In most situations, this is either when a worker has made a mistake and is afraid of admitting it, or when they are a minority for a specific opinion within the company [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md).

This is especially relevant in hierarchical situations. For example, if a boss can say anything but the workers have to watch what their saying, this is not a case of psychological safety. Similarly, a company where the bosses would never punish anyone for speaking up, but the workers are not aware of that, this is still not a case of psychological safety.

**Meaning that it requires both fulfilling it, and making the workers be aware of it.** [Visibility](/notes/visibility.md)

Psychological safety increases the chances that workers will choose to voice their concerns and [speak up](/notes/standing-up-for-yourself.md) instead of leaving, maintaining the status quo or become a secret saboteur [Organizational Conflict](/notes/organizational-conflict.md).

When people feel safe, they are more likely to be [vulnerable](/notes/vulnerability.md), which can lead to stronger connection and [peer support](/notes/peer-support.md) among colleagues. Similarly, when people feel safe, they are much more likely to [admit](/notes/accountability.md) their mistakes, and do what it takes to learn and improve, rather than hide and deflect. It what leads to a learning culture [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md).

Usually, a culture with psychological safety is also a culture of [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md). People feel as if they are working towards a shared goal, which is why they support rather than punish people who failed, because punishing them doesn't support the common goal.
