# Coping

## Notes

Coping methods are ways we handle/[perceive](/notes/subjective-reality.md) the world, usually to avoid pain that emanates from certain experiences. To take an extreme example, religion often helps us deal with loss because we believe it was ordained by god, that there is somehow a good reason for it, and we let go of constantly asking ourselves why and drowning in [Despair](/notes/depression.md).

However, not all coping strategies are of equal worth. Some are more harmful, like [Escapism](/notes/escapism.md), where we decide to avoid experiences all together and focus on something that makes the pain go away, even if momentarily. 

Similarly, [Victim mentality](/notes/helplessness.md) is another, because it allows us to shift the blame from us to the outside world. It too avoids the tough questions of what have I done wrong and what can I do better. 

Lastly, [Pessimism](/notes/pessimism.md) is another coping mechanism, to avoid the frightening uncertainty of the world, we believe that the worst outcome will always prevail, so that we are not "surprised" when it happens. This fake sense of control is the benefit of pessimism.
