# Layering

## Notes

To learn or re-learn something is not to [forget](/notes/forgetfulness.md)/delete what we once thought about this subject, but rather add a new layer of knowledge. when we will access our knowledge on this topic, it will work from the inside out (so basically we're creating a mount of knowledge) [Coherentism](/notes/coherentism.md).

This also means that change is perhaps not similar to [Creative Destruction](/notes/creative-destruction.md), but rather simply adding new layers of personality of who we are. We might feel different but in the end we are still the same person deep down.

This perhaps supports our [Objectivity](/notes/objectivity.md), that some things in us are somewhat [fixed](/notes/fixed-mindset.md), immutable, that at best we can cover them up, making them less likely to appear, but deep down they still exist. Whether it is due to our genes or our environment [nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md), our ability to change and grow is [limited](/notes/limits.md). This also suggests that our [multitude](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md) is not a matter of independent, co-existing voices, rather than the different layers of our identity, resurfacing depending on the situation.
