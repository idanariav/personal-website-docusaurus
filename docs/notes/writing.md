# Writing

## Notes

Writing, like [Journaling](/notes/journaling.md), is a form of creating and expressing thoughts. Written language is one of the main ways of communication, especially in the digital age.

Writing, despite it being created by a single person, is a shared work of art. As opposed to thinking, it assumes an audience. We write because someone else will read it. It requires [mindsight](/notes/mindsight.md) to be able to create a bridge between my thoughts and yours, to escape the problem of [reading minds](/notes/theory-of-mind.md).

Writing is often inflicted with the [Curse of Knowledge](/notes/curse-of-knowledge.md), it is hard for us to forget what it's like to be a reader that doesn't yet know the content of your writings, to remember to explain what seems obvious to us, and think about what would be most useful for them based on their circumstances, not yours.
