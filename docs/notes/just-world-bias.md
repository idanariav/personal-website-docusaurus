# Just World Bias

## Notes

The "Just world" Bias means good things happens to us because we deserve it, and bad stuff because of bad luck. and vice versa to other people. [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md)


1. when something bad happens to us, we usually tend to relate it to bad [Context](/notes/context.md), such as: i had a bad day, i didn't sleep/eat/drink enough.
2. when something bad happens to others, we relate it to their personality - "they are stupid/uncaring/careless..." we [Blame](/notes/blame.md) the person and don't consider to look for the causal factors the same way we do with ourselves. 
3. we think that there must be a "just reason" that bad things happen to bad people, and good things to good people. [Karma 2bc](/notes/karma-2bc.md)
4. for the same reason, when something good happens to us its because of our abilities and skills, but when it happens to others its because of chance or underlying privileges. the more we recognize our faults and virtues in ourselves and in others equally, the more [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md) we will have.

Therefore, we should:
1. You should always hold  [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) at the first time you hear something good/bad about someone, first gather information
2. next, analyze this information with a bit of grace, remember that bad circumstances can be involved
3. always try to imagine other people trying to be their best
