# Temptation Bundling

## Notes

Temptation Bundling is the idea that if we want to increase the likelihood of doing something that we don't like, we can bundle it together with something that we do like. [Love what is good](/notes/love-what-is-good.md). It reduces the need to activate our [limited willpower](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md) because it is replaced with the natural [desire](/notes/desire.md) to do so (to get that dopamine hit). In some sense that reduces the [Friction](/notes/friction.md) associated with performing the action.

For example, we can perhaps watch an episode of our guilty-pleasure TV show during running on the treadmill. Or we can listen to our favorite songs while washing dishes.
The goal is not to make the activity more [enjoyable](/notes/gamification.md), but to also link mentally between those two activities such that we would actually be tempted to do it, like Pablov and his dogs when he ringed his bell [Habit formation](/notes/habit-formation.md).

An advanced step would be to only do those enjoyable activates while doing the chore, which will be more beneficial due to:
1. **Higher tolerance** - it will help avoid the [Hedonic Treadmill](/notes/hedonic-treadmill.md) that comes from over exposure to something. If we only watch tv while working out, it probably means that we won't watch that much tv throughout the week, so it will still be enjoyable even after many weeks.
2. **Time management** - It also makes it a good way of balancing between our desire for [leisure](/notes/leisure.md) and a more "effective" use of our time. This way [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md) are less harmful because at least we do something beneficial along the way
3. **Avoiding indulgence** - preforming good habits is usually taxing, which makes us susceptible to [Moral Licensing](/notes/moral-licensing.md), where we reward ourselves too much after a good behavior. If we only reward ourselves during the behavior it makes us more resilient to indulgence.
