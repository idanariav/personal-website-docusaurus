# Rationalism

## Notes

According to Rationalism, "**truth is within us**", by using our logic and rationality, by [introspection](/notes/introspection.md) we can arrive at certain [truths](/notes/truth.md) not only about human nature but also about the world. This is in contrast with [Empiricism](/notes/empiricism.md), that claims that truth is "out there".

This was the common dogma between philosophers up to the enlightenment. The most famous example is perhaps [Rene Descartes](/notes/rene-descartes-philosopher.md) that has "reasoned" the existence of his soul, and from there everything else. Technically, you can arrive at truths without ever leaving your house, creating the meme of the "armchair philosopher".

Perhaps if we assume a certain level of [Oneness](/notes/unity.md), a connection between us and the world, our identity, our mind and our soul, we can reason that the distinction between "inner world" and "outer world" are unclear or even non existent, and that diving deep within ourselves is the same as reaching out into the world. According to this, finding truths about the world deep within us do makes sense.

However, rationalism has some flaws, mainly that it denies [diversity](/notes/diversity.md) of logics. It is as if there can only be one type of logic, one type of reasoning, such that all people could and would come to the same conclusion. Even the stem professions are filled with disagreements so it's not clear that one logical conclusion is possible even amongst professional in mathematical fields. Perhaps pure math is the one thing that we could agree on, but 1+1 = 2 is far from being the same as accessing truths about human nature. A [reduction](/notes/reductionism.md) argument faces problems when combined with rationalism.

Similarly, rationalism assumes some form of [objectivism](/notes/objectivism.md), although rationalism has no claims about the external world, it does assume that our rationality is free from any subjective influence, and capable of accessing objective truths about the world.

Lastly, rationalism uses logic as it's main and only method of inquiry, a [system 2](/notes/system-2.md) approach, rejecting emotions as valuable information. However, to be human means much more than to be a brain in a vat. The [mind and body](/notes/mind-body-connection.md) are strongly linked, influencing one another, which means that even "internal" truths extended beyond our mind.
