# System 2

## Notes

System 2, as opposed to [System 1](/notes/system-1.md) represents our [rational thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md). This is a slow and costly process, however it is useful for [complex](/notes/complexity.md) situations that can't be handled through an [automated](/notes/heuristics.md) basic response.

This system enables all that we are familiar with as an "intelligible species". Our ability to avoid [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md), activating both of our [Executive Attention Network](/notes/executive-attention-network.md) and our [Default Mode Network](/notes/downtime-brain.md) are dependent on the existence of system 2.

However, this doesn't mean that system 2 is perfect and should be the only way of thinking at all times. Left unchecked, using only system 2 can lead to excess use of [Rationalization](/notes/rationalization.md), where we justify ourselves no matter what, and turns ourselves into [Econs](/notes/econs.md) that operate solely by cold calculations. Patients who have lost their system 1 have a very cold and calculated way of seeing the world, while also lacking [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) to act, even according with things they agree in, as if our morality is somehow imbued at least partially in our emotions [morality is both rational and emotional](/notes/morality-is-both-rational-and-emotional.md).
