# Addiction

## Notes

Addiction is the worse kind of [Escapism](/notes/escapism.md), it is when we lose our ability to exert [Self-control](/notes/self-control.md), and become an [object](/notes/objectivity.md), a [slave](/notes/dependency.md) in the hands of something else. For example, to be addicted to alcohol is not the same as saying that you enjoy drinking it, but rather feel compelled to do it even when you suffer from it, that you can't think of anything else. It is more than just [Temptations](/notes/procrastination.md), it is when your entire being is enslaved to that thing.

When addicted, we become [helpless](/notes/helplessness.md), we lose control over our lives, and even after realizing that we are addicted, it is still not enough to break free from it. We feel like victims under the addiction's power, unable to break free.

Usually addiction starts from an emotional crisis, a need for solace becomes a dependency that laches unto us, which makes the situation worse because it rubs us of our capability to reach [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md) and solve our problems on our own, leading to a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md).

Addiction is hard to undo. Usually it requires a form of a [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md), a drastic and immediate change that removes us (or the addiction) from our environment, but this is only half the picture. After changing our environment, we have to change our habits, and only with time we could break free from it's influence.
