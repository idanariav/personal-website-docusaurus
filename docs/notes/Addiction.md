# Addiction

## Notes

Addiction is the worse kind of [Escapism](/notes/escapism.md), it is when we lose our ability to exert [Self-control](/notes/self-control.md), and we become an [object](/notes/objectivity.md), a slave in the hands of something else. For example, to be addicted to alcohol is not the same as saying that you enjoy drinking it, but rather feel compelled to do it even when you suffer from it, that you can't think of anything else. It is more than just [Temptations](/notes/procrastination.md), it is when your entire being is enslaved to that thing.

Usually addiction starts from an emotional crisis, a need for solace becomes a dependency that laches unto us, which makes the situation worse because it rubs us of our capability to reach [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md) and solve our problems on our own, leading to a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md).
