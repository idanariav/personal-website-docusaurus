# Giving

## Notes

A mindset of providing value with no expected return, or out of true desire to help.
This supports the idea that [humans are good as default](/notes/humans-are-good-as-default.md), that we were born to connect [Communication is in our nature](/notes/communication-is-in-our-nature.md), that we sometimes can beat [Self Bias](/notes/self-bias.md)

Altruism is a perception by which we act in a way that is beneficial to others or to society as a whole, even at the cost of our own. [Human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md)
For example, volunteering around the clock and getting little pay is an altruistic act, similarly donating your kidney to a stranger without getting anything in return. Altruistic acts are therefore acts where you give without expecting something in return, when you have the other person's wellbeing in mind instead of your own.
**However, perhaps it is not surprising that while our goal is the other person's wellbeing, we in the process improve our own, because giving to others is one the best ways to boost our own happiness** [Happiness is shared](/notes/happiness-is-shared.md)

There are those who claim that true altruism doesn't exist because if it is a choice you made then that means you got something out of it, for example you enjoy the thought that you saved someone's life, or enjoy being a volunteer, but this is ridiculing ethics, in my opinion, since a person who jumps on a grenade to save his friends didn't do this out of enjoyment. Altruism is more a question of obligation than satisfaction [Deontology](/notes/deontology.md).

Altruism is often done towards our inner circle, although not exclusively. We might be more altruistic towards our own community, country, etc.. [us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md)

Giving usually have a [Ripple effect](/notes/ripple-effect.md), when we are kind to others, they are more likely to be kind in return, and not just to us, to others as well. When we give, we fight the forces of [Econs](/notes/econs.md) and [Commodification](/notes/commodification.md). We show ourselves and others that monetary value is not the only thing in life, and especially not the most important one.
