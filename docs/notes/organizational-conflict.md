# Reactional behavior

## Notes

What happens if we don't feel [safe](/notes/psychological-safety.md) at the environment we are in, could be an organization, a workplace, even a family. When we have bad experiences in that place, we have four possible ways of reaction, which are divided along two axis - positive/negative and [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md) vs passive.
1. **Voice** - (positive + proactive). We don't accept the situation as it is, and we try to make it better by voicing our opinions 
2. **Exit** - (negative + proactive). similarly to voice, we do something about it, but we choose to leave instead of trying to make it better
3. **Neglect** - (negative + passive) a form of [Reactance](/notes/reactance.md). We stay in the same place and choose to rebel silently. We don't do or act as required of us, try to cut corners or use loopholes whenever possible without letting anyone know
4. **Persistence** - (positive + passive). We try to "make it work", to get adjusted to the bad situation as it is, perhaps it will pass, perhaps we will learn to see things differently.

Note that being proactive could be very scary, it means to go against the actual or perceived norms of the group [Standing up for yourself](/notes/standing-up-for-yourself.md), and going against [Status-quo bias](/notes/status-quo-bias.md), believing we can have something better, either there or elsewhere.

Remember that no matter how you feel, you always have the [Freedom of response](/notes/agency.md)
