# Trust the Process

## Notes

Trust the process means that we should put our trust on [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md), by understanding what are the most likely outcomes following certain actions, we should trust that sticking to those actions will produce the best results, even if some [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) is involved within it. For example, if we want to write a book, it is enough to focus on writing half an hour every day. The final result (a finished book), would come eventually, so there's no point in worrying about it.

The [small](/notes/start-small.md) steps we do today are what ensures us that we will reach our destination.

We usually hold in a high regard the importance of goals, especially as our main tool for success. However, focusing solely on goals can be problematic because:
1. **Lack clarity** - goals are usually more abstract, so it's harder to translate a goal into real life actions. For example, "I want to be successful writer" - what does that mean? When have I achieved it? (Related:: **[Ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md)**)
2. **short sighted** - what happens if you complete your goal? then you're left with nothing, and you have to start the process all over again. Usually at a price of deflation of motivation. Meaning goals can often serve as a [External Motivation](/notes/external-motivation.md), a reward at the end of the tunnel which leaves us empty once we reach it.
3. **Don't change who we are** - we can say to ourselves "I want to lose weight", and we might even achieve it, but we are still the same person.
4. **Binary thinking** - Goals are often [binary](/notes/binary-thinking.md), either we reached them or not, which fails to capture the complexity of human behavior and motivation.

Habits, on the other hand, are more [reliable](/notes/stability.md). Mainly because a habit is an expression of our identity [change starts from the inside out](/notes/change-starts-from-the-inside-out.md). Instead of "I want to lose weight", habits say "I want to become a healthy person".

Additionally, habits reframe the meaning of success from a binary yes/no to a continuum. Missing a habit for a day doesn't mean you have failed.

Furthermore, by preforming good habits, you can be certain that you make good [progress](/notes/consistency.md) daily, so that the outcomes you wish for will come naturally "by themselves". At first the results look insignificant, but over time they [compound](/notes/compounding.md). For example, writing 15 minutes a day doesn't sound a lot if you wish to become a writer, but when it translates into 7.5 hours a month it suddenly sounds enough to do something towards your goal.

Focus on the process, not the outcome.
