# Detox

## Notes

To clean yourself from an [Addiction](/notes/addiction.md), usually involves removing any aspect of that addiction in your life. When talking about digital detox, it involves having a "sabbath", or clear rules when you can't use your phone, and or reduce it's capabilities

Detoxing usually requires [Rigid rules](/notes/rigid-rules.md), because if we still have any left in our system, or if we leave any room for excuses or "just this once", we won't be able to fully recover and clean ourselves of that influence.

Detoxing allows us to trigger the [Fresh start effect](/notes/clean-slate.md), where we can choose a new lifestyle now that we are not longer influenced by that addiction.
