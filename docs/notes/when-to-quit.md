# When to Quit

## Notes

We have a tendency to maintain the [status quo](/notes/status-quo-bias.md), to continue with the [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md) of our lives even when it is not the best course of action for it.

### Why We Tend to Overlook Quitting:
1. **emphasize appearance** - we are affected by [Survivors Bias](/notes/survivors-bias.md). we thing that all those who are successful in life have never quit anything, that their success is by not giving up. its wrong - those who are successful did so because they knew when and what to quit, and what would help them achieve their success the most.
2. **Sunk cost** - we are affected by [Sunk Cost](/notes/sunk-cost.md). we are using the effort we made as an excuse to keep going, even when it doesn't make since, and usually just makes it worse since the more I put in, the more I'm risking to lose, and the less I put in what would really improve me.
3. **Binary success** - we measure success as a binary true/false. either I completed the race or I failed. therefore we might risk a lot just to reach our goal, blind to the true costs along the way. [binary thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md)
4. **Quitting is loosing** - We sometimes overvalue the concept of [Grit](/notes/grit.md), that we must carry on no matter the consequences, that by quitting we admit to our weaknesses.
5. **Fear of uncertainty** - The life we have now is [visible](/notes/visibility.md), even if it's bad, we know how it's like. Contrastingly, quitting and going on a new path is a path filled with [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md), and that makes us ;[Fear](/notes/fear.md) it very much.

### Conclusion:
6. **don't be enslaved to past decisions** - in a world that constantly changes, and so are we, it is harmful to think that a decision of the past can enslave us indefinitely. [Path Dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md)
7. **expiration clause** - each decision should come with an expiration clause. "I will do this unless X happens" (unless the stock losses 10% of its value, unless I see that I'm unhappy in this job...). [scientific method](/notes/scientific-method.md).
8. **internal consistency** - we should stand true to our commitment as long as they are consistent with our values and match our goals. while its not easy to see when we should quit, we should be aware of that possibility and make our decisions wisely in light of advantages/disadvantages of each choice.
