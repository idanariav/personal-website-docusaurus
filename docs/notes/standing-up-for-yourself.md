# Standing up for Yourself

## Notes

To stand up for yourself can be seen as a combination of [Authenticity](/notes/authenticity.md) when it clashes against the [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md) that tries to tell us differently. It can also be seen as having the courage to face your [Fear](/notes/fear.md) and be able to act according to your values not for lack of fear, but rather through the understanding that there's something more important, an abondance of [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) that fuels you to act.

If and when you start to lose faith in the path you have set up for yourself, it is helpful to fuel yourself with [Self affirmation](/notes/self-affirmation.md)

Courage often stems from having a [Safe Base](/notes/safe-base.md) to return to. Something that gives us strength, support and safety when we take risks [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md). For example to gamble all your money when you are poor is difficult, but gambling when you are financially sound is easier. An educational example can be - pushing someone out the door is counterproductive unless we say that they are always welcome to come back, and we will always be there for them
