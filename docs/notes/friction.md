# Friction

## Notes

Friction is usually something we want to avoid in life. Many of our day to day actions are determined not by our [willpower](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md) but rather the level of friction of each action, meaning that we tend to stick to the [Defaults](/notes/defaults.md) and choose the path of less resistance, or more accurately, the easy path is the [default](/notes/defaults.md) path.

Friction is often unconscious, although it is a main reason we choose or avoid certain actions. Therefore, it is suggested that the most efficient improvement in life satisfaction could come from reduction in friction, brining more [Simplicity](/notes/simplicity.md) in our lives.

This idea goes against the idea that a [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md) is something that is beneficial to us. That only through facing difficulties we can grow [Adversarial Growth](/notes/creative-destruction.md). Similarly, it could be said that when something is too easy it becomes [boring](/notes/boredom.md), creating a feeling of emptiness, of meaninglessness. Also, sometimes we want friction, especially when we want to make bad choices harder to make, or to add [Stability](/notes/stability.md) to a process, like how security checks at the airport are a major friction, yet we want to preserve these because otherwise the risk is just too great. 

To reduce friction, we can:
1. **Make it short** - either by making something highly [available](/notes/the-20-seconds-rule.md), or limiting the [scope](/notes/5-minute-rule.md) of what we are trying to do
2. **Make it fun** - doing a task will be much more tempting (and therefore with less friction) if it will be [fun](/notes/gamification.md)
3. **Do it consistently** - Our mind resists less when we do things we have done in the past, because after a few times it becomes a [habit](/notes/habit-formation.md), so [Consistency](/notes/consistency.md) is more important than [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md)
4. **Change the settings** - we are highly influenced by our environment. [changing](/notes/nudge.md) our environment to match our desired habits, making them the new default, is the most effective thing we can do. Like having a book on our desk would make reading easier.
