# the 2 minute rule

## Notes

if you can do this task in under 2 minutes, do it now.
This is meant as an alternative to prioritizing tasks [Task Batching](/notes/task-batching.md). Instead of spending time processing this task, there are simply cases where it is more efficient to directly do it rather than postpone it.  [Perfect is the enemy of good](/notes/perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good.md).
