# Prevention

## Notes

Prevention can be considered as a type of [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md), because we handle a problem while it is still small or even none existent, instead of dealing it with when it is large, complicated or urgent. It is also a form of [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md), we make an initial investment now in order to save much more down the road. It is a much easier and healthier version of [Risk Management](/notes/risk-management.md) because we take care of problems while the risk is low.

Prevention requires us first to know what we are trying to prevent, and take a [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md). approach rather than dealing with problems as they arise. For example, a process of [Pre-Mortem](/notes/pre-mortem.md) might help us discover in advance what could go wrong and what can we do about it. Since [Problems](/notes/problems.md) have a [Ripple effect](/notes/ripple-effect.md), preventing problems in advance solves much more than the immediate effect. For example, a certain disease might be so taxing that you would have to quit work, so taking a vaccine against that disease saves you not only from that illness, but also from losing your job.
