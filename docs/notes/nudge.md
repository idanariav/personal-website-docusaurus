# Nudge

## Notes

We can distinguish between two similar yet different forms of affecting our environment. The first is a nudge.

Nudge is a soft, low effort change, a way to influence a persons actions by influencing the method/order of choices that are presented to him, without changing or limiting the choices themselves.
Two common examples are:
1. supermarkets - by putting unhealthy food at eye-level, there is a higher chance that people would by these items
2. Forms - people would rarely change the default in a form, for example having a form where organ donation is the default would increase donations in comparison with a form where not donating is the default

in both cases, nobody was forced to do anything differently, but the fact that some things were easier to do then others [Friction](/notes/friction.md) made them be the more popular choice. [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md)

The second is environmental design, which is a hard, high effort change that creates/eliminates certain choices. The difference between putting the cookies in the topmost drawer and not buying them in the first place.

Nudge is often reliant on using [Cues](/notes/priming.md) to our advantage, we create an environment which makes it easier to send the signals that will trigger the desired behavior. Sometimes the environment is so full of negative cues that we need a [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md), usually by changing the environment itself rather than it's components so that it could be manipulated in the first place. The advantage of a nudge is that it only has to be done once, one time where we make an effort to change the environment, and then it will come naturally to us, instead of brute forcing using our [willpower](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md) each time [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md).

Thinking through the lens of environmental design means expanding the concept of the self to include our environment as well as a significant part of determining our actions, which requires to take [Ownership](/notes/ownership.md) not just on "ourselves" as a person with a body, but also on our environment in which we live in. Once our environment matches our values, we can finally reach a state of [harmony](/notes/harmonious-self.md)

Common phenomenon related to nudge:
1. **Caching** - In life as in with computers, it is useful to build it in such a way that whichever we predict to be more useful, whichever we have used more in the past, the easier it should be to use again. [Caching](/notes/caching.md)
2. **Insights gap** - Whenever we act against our best interest, we probably need a nudge to help us stay on track [Akrasia](/notes/akrasia.md)
3. **Nutrition** - this is a classic case of limiting distractions instead of trying to fight time. Usually nutrition is all about making healthy choices easier to make, and reducing encounters with unhealthy food [Nutrition](/notes/nutrition.md)
4. **Distractions** - often our goal with environmental design is to limit [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md) as much as possible, so that we will avoid the temptations all together without ever facing them
