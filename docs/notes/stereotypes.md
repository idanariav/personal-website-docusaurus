# Stereotypes

## Notes

Stereotypes are when we try to use [Mental Shortcuts](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md) to gain information about a person without having to invest time and energy in getting to know them. We infer (real or imagined) qualities of the group on the individual [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md), or group together people based on (real or imagined) shared qualities [form vs essence](/notes/form-vs-essence.md). This is a built-in [mechanism](/notes/system-1.md) in our mind designed to make our social awareness easier, and less costly on the brain.

Stereotypes are usually negative, and lead to a [us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md) mentality, where we dehumanize and create negative stereotypes on members of the other group. Stereotypes can also be self inflicted. Like a [Placebo effect](/notes/placebo-effect.md), if we believe the stereotypes of the group we are a member of, it might become true (for us). For example, if girls believe that they are bad at math, then they will actually perform worse than man.
