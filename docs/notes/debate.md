# Debate

## Notes

Debate is a confrontational form of deliberation. Instead of trying to find together a shared solution, we see the world as a [Zero sum](/notes/binary-thinking.md) game and believe that only one view is correct and possible. 

Like most competitions, we can treat the debate as an honorable way of figuring out the [Truth](/notes/truth.md), or we can do our best to make the other side look weak, unreliable, and break apart their arguments without truly addressing them.

However, for the sake of the truth and logic, a better rebuttal is one the addresses only the core message of the opponent's argument, without attacking their identity, using a straw man, or any other form of manipulation.
