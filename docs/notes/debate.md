# Debate

## Notes

Debate is a confrontational form of deliberation. Instead of trying to find together a shared solution, we see the world as a [Zero sum](/notes/binary-thinking.md) game and believe that only one view is correct and possible.

Like most competitions, we can treat the debate as an honorable way of figuring out the [Truth](/notes/truth.md), or we can do our best to make the other side look weak, unreliable, and break apart their arguments without truly addressing them.

However, for the sake of the truth and logic, a better rebuttal is one the addresses only the core message of the opponent's argument, without attacking their identity, using a straw man, or any other form of manipulation.

The order of the strengh of your argument is (from low to high):
1. Name calling
2. ad hominem (attacking their character)
3. Responding to tone (how they say it and not what they say)
4. Contradiction ("strawman" their argument)
5. Counter argument
6. Refutation
7. Refuting their central argument
