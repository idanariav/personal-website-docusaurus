# Humility

## Notes

Humility is perhaps the opposite of [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md), it is to put our [Ego](/notes/form-vs-essence.md) aside, and acknowledge that we might make mistakes and don't know everything, and to be satisfied with who we are and what we have [Minimalism](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md). You don't need [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md) to be humble, you might be humble as a "precaution", but it often goes together.

Humility is very difficult to [balance](/notes/balance-extremes.md), if we have too little, we might fall back into over confidence, if we have too much, we might experience [Imposter Syndrome](/notes/imposter-syndrome.md). It requires to have sufficient [Confidence](/notes/self-worth.md), yet not too much of it.

Practicing humility can help us stay in a [Beginner's Mind](/notes/beginners-mind.md), to be "forever the student" in new situations, recognizing that we always have much to [learn](/notes/growth-mindset.md), to be [curious](/notes/curiosity.md), and to be open to other viewpoints. Humility also goes well with the [scientific method](/notes/scientific-method.md). We don't get too [attached](/notes/attachment.md) to whatever we believe, knowing that we might be wrong, and we can easily [align](/notes/adaptability.md) ourselves based on the evidence.
