# Emergence

## Notes

Emergence is **when the whole is larger than the sum of its parts**. It is when the whole has different features that don't exists in the individual units [Reductionism](/notes/reductionism.md), meaning that you can't find it if you look too [close](/notes/atomism.md), you have to [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md). Those features are created from the synergy and interaction between the different components. A level of [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md) is added from combining them together, in terms of not only complex structure, but also complex outputs or capabilities.

You cant "see" the emergence , similar to a state that supposably is nothing more than people and buildings, but somehow it exists, it has a "soul", a history, a purpose and intention. Even though it's citizens come and go, the state as an emerging identity will remain [Theseus ship](/notes/theseus-ship.md).

However, you can understand emergent properties better once you look at the [function](/notes/functionalism.md) each part is performing as part of a greater [system](/notes/systematical-thinking.md).

Another example is our consciousness. When we look at each individual neuron, we see only a biological robot operating based on chemistry and electrical signals, without free will. However as a whole we often do tend to claim that we have free will, so where does it come from?

Similarly, the advantages of a good knowledge system stem not from the quality of each individual note (although that helps), but on the [connections](/notes/coherentism.md) between them. It's hard to design such systems in advance, because at first the emerging property will not exist, it can't be created beforehand, it is the result of a good, interconnected system.

Although it is based on connections, emergent properties are based not only on the number of connections, but also their strength. a system that is too complex and has too many parts might reduce the strength of these connections, so sometimes [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md).
