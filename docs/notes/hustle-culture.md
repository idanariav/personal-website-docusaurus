# Hustle Culture

## Notes

We somethings feel like we want to "do it all", to be everything everywhere all at once. The hustle culture is a form of [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md) that drives us to constantly be busy, to view business as a [proxy](/notes/mcnamara-fallacy.md) for progress and growth, even when it isn't, and the only sure outcome is [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md).

When we embrace the hustle culture, we surrender to the [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) of others, that material things and status are what's most important, and that any time spent [Relaxing](/notes/rest.md) is time wasted. It causes us to focus more on our [image](/notes/form-vs-essence.md) rather than developing our nourishing who we are as people.

To escape the hustle culture, we first have to [slow down](/notes/slowing-down.md), and start [Saying no](/notes/saying-no.md) to the unreasonable demands of work and societies expectations of success. We should remember that richness is not a matter of quantity, but quality. It is the one who is satisfied with what they have that is rich, while paradoxically it is those who are constantly searching for more that will never be satisfied, no matter how much they have.

It is like the tale about the businessman who meets a fisherman, that suggests him to work hard, start a fishing company, so that in 20-30 years he could relax and enjoy the fruits of their success, while the fisherman says that relaxing and enjoying his life is exactly what he's doing now, so why spend so much time just to reach where he is now?

Suffering for the sake of suffering is not something to be proud of, yet somehow we glorify those who stay late at the office, who work around the clock including weekends, and that sacrifice their personal life for the success of their company. Is their life truly something we want to have? I think not, I think that they have been [lost in the finite](/notes/lost-in-the-finite.md), that they have dedicated themselves into a goal that does little for their growth as people, only using them as tools, which they will realize only later in life when it's too late.

Doing it all is false god. Because [Multitasking doesnt exist](/notes/multitasking-doesnt-exist.md), we pay the price of splitting our attention into so many things, yet forgetting the things that truly matter.
