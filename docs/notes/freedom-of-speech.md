# Freedom of Speech

## Notes

Freedom of speech is considered one of the basic tenants of modern society. It allows [Deliberation](/notes/deliberation.md) and [Debate](/notes/debate.md), the exchange of ideas and perspective, and it is the basis of any feeling of [Psychological safety](/notes/psychological-safety.md). Without it, people would feel suppressed, and we would lack [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md) because only the "ruling" voice would be heard.
