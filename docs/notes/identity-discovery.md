# Identity Discovery

## Notes

Identity discovery often occurs during conversations or moments that challenge who we are, that causes us to ask "the big questions", and often lead to [stress](/notes/stress.md). What makes these moments difficult is that our internal [Narratives](/notes/narratives.md) of who we are and what we believe in doesn't match what we have done or who we want to become, therefore creating [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), and breaking our [Cognitive Alignment](/notes/cognitive-alignment.md). This can also be triggered when we break one of our [Rigid rules](/notes/rigid-rules.md)

Challenging moments contains three levels:
1. **What happened** - how we perceive reality and the context of the situation based on our narrative [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md)
2. **Our feelings** - how the story of what happened affects us, which feelings it causes, how do we express them.
3. **Our identity** - how does this narrative affect on who I am as a person. What does it tell about me, how does it define me.

Usually, a conflicting narrative is very harmful to our sense of self. So more likely we will change the narrative, or accept it and break down.
