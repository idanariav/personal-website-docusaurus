# Globalization

## Notes

Globalization means the connectedness of cultures, ideas, systems and institutions across the world. In general, the more globalized the society we are in, the more we are forced to find our [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md) because we are suddenly not alone anymore, anyone out there is a potential competitor, which means we have to "step up" our game. Automation and [outsourcing](/notes/outsourcing.md) is a similar threat, where jobs that we tended to feel secure in are now replaced by others, whether machines or humans.
