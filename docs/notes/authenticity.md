# Authenticity

## Notes

**Authenticity is the measure by which we are true to ourselves, whether we are acting in a coherent way with our [Core Values](/notes/core-values.md)**. Being authentic requires a certain level of [Agency](/notes/agency.md), since otherwise it is not you who determines your actions but outside forces.

Authenticity is not only an outwards facing concept, such as whether my life choices, the way I speak and act match my true nature, but also inwards. To be inauthentic could also mean to lie to yourself, to be in [Denial](/notes/denial.md) or to experience self oppression. For example, often our desire to be socially accepted can cause us to act like how others [expects](/notes/expectations.md) us to act, rather than following who we wish to be [form vs essence](/notes/form-vs-essence.md). Social forces are often stronger than we think, and while it is irrational to say that we can think, live and even [define](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md) ourselves separately from others, we can still avoid the forces of "following the [Herd](/notes/social-environment.md)".

Therefore to be authentic requires also a measure of [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md), while also having the [Courage](/notes/standing-up-for-yourself.md) to follow through and be yourself.

Authenticity is one indication of achieving an [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md). This alignment within ourselves and expressing it fully and truthfully to the outside world shows that we know who we are, that we [accept](/notes/validation.md) who we are, not ashamed of it, and wish to live our true self.
