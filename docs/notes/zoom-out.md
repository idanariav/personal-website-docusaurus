# Zoom out

## Notes

To zoom out means to change our [Perspective](/notes/subjective-reality.md) and gain [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md), and often combines with [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md). It is to either think of the "big picture", or the "long game" [Short term bias](/notes/present-bias.md). To step outside of the current situation and view it as an observer, rather than as an experiencer [experience knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md). It also means to think more abstractly, and try to connect different points of information that on the surface looks different [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md).

Often, zooming out allows us to take a [Break](/notes/rest.md), to [slow down](/notes/slowing-down.md) which is essential for our wellbeing. It helps us avoid, or revert cases of [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md), by stepping outside ourselves, trying to see things as they are [Objectivism](/notes/objectivism.md), and think about other people and not just ourselves [Self Bias](/notes/self-bias.md).
