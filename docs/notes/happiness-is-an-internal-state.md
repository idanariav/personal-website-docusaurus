# Happiness is an internal state

## Notes

There are two ways by which this statement is true, one is by "what is", and the other is by "what ought to".
1. **Is** - we are usually wrong at assuming what would make us happy [Future disillusionment](/notes/future-disillusionment.md). Being reliant on external factors for happiness such as money or fame usually brings more sadness than happiness. Even when we succeed it turns out worse than expected. Lottery winners are [not happier](/notes/hedonic-treadmill.md) than people who got into a car accident. **If happiness doesn't come from the outside, then it must come from within.** [Happiness is contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md)
2. **Ought** - being [reliant](/notes/dependency.md) on external factors for happiness is a great source of [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) and disruption in our lives. It gives the outside world power over us, and it is a power that is best kept for ourselves. The difference between happiness and pleasure is similar to suffering and pain. While pain and pleasures are sensations, suffering and happiness are mental states, which means that we choose to act this way, and we can detach it from outside influences [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md). Therefore **happiness is a choice, rather than a circumstance**.

This doesn't mean that being happy is a simple choice, we often feel overwhelmed by things in our lives, we feel suffocated, [helpless](/notes/helplessness.md), unable to do anything besides going through the motions. While it is tough, it is possible. It starts with acknowledging your [freedom of choice](/notes/agency.md), you are always capable of choosing how to [view](/notes/subjective-reality.md) certain events, even if you can't determine what happens  [Acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md). For example, by practicing [Gratitude](/notes/gratitude.md) you are already making the steps to view the positive in your life, and turning happiness from something dependent on the external world to something you have power over [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md).
