# Self-awareness

## Notes

Self awareness, aka "know thyself", is to be aware of your personality traits, your thoughts, reasons for your actions or emotions. If [introspection](/notes/introspection.md) is the tool, the self awareness is the outcome of using it.

Without self awareness, it is easy, if not obligatory, that we become slaves to our desires or others' influence. Without knowing who you are, what kind of life you want, what are your values and which thoughts or habits are holding you back, in what sense do you have [Agency](/notes/agency.md)? Choosing a direction without knowing where you want to go is useless. In the same sense, we can't have [Authenticity](/notes/authenticity.md) without self awareness. Because to act according to who you are requires knowing that.

When we know ourselves, we take the first step towards liberating ourselves from what holds us back [free will is knowledge](/notes/free-will-is-knowledge.md). We can be [intentional](/notes/intentionality.md) about our actions, without falling into traps such as [Emotional Projection](/notes/emotional-projection.md) or simply going with our [gut](/notes/intuition.md).

When we know ourselves, it is much easier to approach life with [Humility](/notes/humility.md), to know exactly when your knowledge ends so that you won't act or assume to know things that you don't. You are also much more likely to be happy [Happiness is contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md), because how would you live a life that aligns with your identity if you don't know who you are.

Lastly, having self knowledge would also make you more efficient, because you will know what your strengths and weaknesses are [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md).

It is said that understanding ourselves goes hand in hand with understanding others [Theory of Mind](/notes/theory-of-mind.md).
