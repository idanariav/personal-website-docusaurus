# Threshold bias

## Notes

we give greater importance when something passes a threshold even when reality is continuous and not discrete [non linear](/notes/non-linear.md) [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md). For example, turning 30 is much more meaningful than being 29 and 11 months. We would surely accept something that is free and avoid it if it costs 5 cents even though 5 cents is negligible. Similarly, converting something from 99% probability to 100% is much more valuable than from 95% to 96%.

The threshold is a form of [Anchoring](/notes/anchoring.md), once it is out there we look at everything differently even though deep down we know it is completely arbitrary.
