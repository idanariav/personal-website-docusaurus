# Mind-Body Duality

## Notes

There is a separation between your body and your soul/mind. According to this view, it is logical to assume that experiences in your body are external to "who you are", they are not indicative of your identity. For example - emotions, urges and hormones are considered as external forces trying to influence your consciousness [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md).

If this is true, than morality is only the result of logical inference [Rationalism](/notes/rationalism.md), and doesn't involve any other type of "signals" such as [experience knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md). Meaning that it goes against the idea that [Morality is both rational and emotional](/notes/morality-is-both-rational-and-emotional.md)
