# Critical Thinking

## Notes

In general, critical thinking means to examine something before believing it, to search for possible ways of looking at it, different perspectives, looking for advantages and disadvantages, and validating the information we have. It is opposed to [Conformation Bias](/notes/conformation-bias.md) where we immediately accept what we see if it supports our view.

Critical thinking can't be done mindlessly, it requires our [Focus](/notes/focus.md) and an activation of our [System 2](/notes/system-2.md) thinking. It is to approach a problem [proactivly](/notes/proactiveness.md), to examine not only the information at hand, but also to see which information is missing [Streetlight effect](/notes/streetlight-effect.md), which other viewpoints are available [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md), whether it is presented in a biased way [Framing](/notes/framing.md), etc.

Critical thinking can also lead to [Ideation](/notes/ideation.md). By refuting and analyzing the current situation, we might come up with new and better ways of doing or thinking about something.

To be a skeptic means to constantly be [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md), to never accept things automatically, rather try to understand them. To approach a question with [Humility](/notes/humility.md) that we might not know the answer, and that we need time and resources to find the best one. It would often require us to [reexamine](/notes/rethinking.md) what we think we know.
