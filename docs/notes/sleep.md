# Sleep

## Notes

Sleep is a keystone habit because all of our daily function, such as motivation, productivity, expressiveness and will power are dependent on sleep [Maslows pyramid](/notes/maslows-pyramid.md). Without it, we are much more likely to feel [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md), and we have much less [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md), which means we will be more prone for distractions and [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md).

Moreover, our memory and ability to learn also depends on sleep. Therefore sleep is not a "waste of time" but rather one of the best investments that we can make [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md), it [boosts](/notes/multiplier.md) all that we try to do while awake. Having a 7-9 hours a day is crucial for our stability and growth.

Tips for better sleep:
1. Have a consistent schedule (when you wake and go to sleep) [Habit formation](/notes/habit-formation.md)
2. Don't miss the first half of the night, most of the "brain cleaning" happens there
3. Stick to the natural cycle of the body. For example, light keeps you awake, so add a lot of light in the morning, but less so at the evening.
4. Alcohol, coffee have bad influence on sleep
5. Keep electronics away from you at night, the less sources of [Stress](/notes/stress.md) the better [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md)
6. Don't eat too much before going to bed [Nutrition](/notes/nutrition.md)
7. Especially for kids and teenagers, the night is crucial for development, so set an example and also go to sleep early
