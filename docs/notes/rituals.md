# Rituals

## Notes

Rituals are a way where we bypass [Self Criticism](/notes/self-criticism.md) and get into the [zone](/notes/flow.md) by overriding our thoughts with a series of predetermined steps. By reducing [Decision points](/notes/decision-points.md), we keep our focus and our mental energy towards what's really important.

For example, an athlete might have the same routine of warmups before a competition, but it can be listening to specific songs and praying just as well. The routine doesn't have to be connected to the activity itself. What matters is that we mentally connected between the ritual and the desired mental state [Placebo effect](/notes/placebo-effect.md).

For example, some have a "lucky routine", that they eat, wear and listen to the same things before a performance. It is not really that these things have an intrinsic value, that they help us perform better because they are helpful, rather they serve as an [Instrumental](/notes/instrumental.md) step in order to be in a state and calm and flow.

As with cases of [Rigid rules](/notes/rigid-rules.md), when we fail to preform the ritual we might get unhinged and fall prey to the [F-it effect](/notes/f-it-effect.md)
