# Path Dependence

## Notes

Path Dependence is the idea that we are highly [limited](/notes/limits.md) by the choices we made in the past, whether they did or did not create systems that now [forces](/notes/dependency.md) us to act in a certain way. A single choice when repeated slowly turns into [Defaults](/notes/defaults.md), and with time it roots so deep that any [change](/notes/adaptability.md) will involve much [Friction](/notes/friction.md).

A common example is the QWERTY keyboard. At first it was designed for type-writers in a way that will make writing a bit harder so that the arms of the typing machine won't clash.

Nowadays, in our digital age, the need to slow down writing due to mechanical reasons is of course non existent, however we are still using QWERTY as our main keyboard, even though there are statistically proven better keyboards layouts out there.

We simply "got used" [Habit formation](/notes/habit-formation.md) to QWERTY because it was popular during the transition between mechanical and digital, and now its so common that no single actor can make a change because it will be impossible to embrace.

Escaping path dependence is always hard, but there are a few situations in which it is possible;
1. **Work together** - a unanimous decision to change together can help us abandon previous paths and start new ones [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md). For example, countries have changed from driving on the left side of the lane to the right, but obviously everyone had to change their driving habits together at the same time, otherwise it would have been a disaster.
2. **Start a new** - We need a [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md), to create a situation free of any external influence, where we can begin anew. Not every path is such an alternative, but where it's possible it's probably the easiest of them all
3. **Break down the old** - Sometimes a force of change is so [powerful](/notes/critical-mass.md) that even entrenched systems can be unrooted and replaced. This is a case of [Creative Destruction](/notes/creative-destruction.md), where the old path becomes so irrelevant or useless that it's replaced in a quick yet destructive manner.
4. **Explore before committing** - To avoid entering path dependence in the first place, or at least select a better path to be stuck it, it's important to [experiment](/notes/testing.md) with different options while you still have the flexibility to do so.
