# People Are not the Problem

## Notes

Unfortunately we have the tendency to be [confrontational](/notes/binary-thinking.md) when we try to solve [Problems](/notes/problems.md) in our lives. We see the other person as the problem, instead of promoting [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md) by seeing them as a partner for solving the same problem [win win situations](/notes/win-win-situations.md).

Treating the other as the problem usually brings [Reactance](/notes/reactance.md), and it [crowd outs](/notes/crowding-out.md) any motivation for cooperation [Micro-Management](/notes/micro-management.md).

Instead, we should remember to give people the benefit of the doubt [Hanlon's Razor](/notes/hanlons-razor.md), and work with them instead of against them. To treat them with [Respect](/notes/validation.md) and validating their point of view and supporting their [self worth](/notes/self-worth.md) because we treat them as equal members that have something to contribute.

Changing how you view others lets you work together instead of against each other, which can serve as a [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md) for problem solving.
