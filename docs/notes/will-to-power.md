# Will to Power

## Notes

Will to power is a force within us that drives us towards [transcendence](/notes/transcendence.md). It is the desire to triumph ourselves, the nature around us, and be something greater than just an animal that has basic needs. It is to avoid our [Objectivity](/notes/objectivity.md) and pursue a higher goal [Maslows pyramid](/notes/maslows-pyramid.md)

It also means to be "life embracing", to have a [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md) attitude towards life, to feel [Ownership](/notes/ownership.md) over the events of our lives, or at least our behavior. This means to approach life with both [Acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md) and [Agency](/notes/agency.md) at the same time, to [Amor Fati](/notes/amor-fati.md), and to reject feelings of [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md)

To follow your will to power means to embrace [Challenges](/notes/struggle.md), to have a [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) and seek improvement through difficulties in life. To overcome yourself, rather than giving yourself up to [Herd Mentality](/notes/social-environment.md)
