# Comparison

## Notes

Comparisons are when we compare ourselves to others, when others become our standard. It can often be seen as a form of [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md), as we often take not only the perfect candidates as an example, but also take their "best version" as a baseline. Like a form of [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md), we see only their best and our worst, ignoring what makes us unique. Similarly, we treat others as a [one-dimensional being](/notes/one-dimensional-being.md), as if they are nothing more than their success, their achievements, or their behavior. Often we fall pray to [Halo effect](/notes/halo-effect.md).

It can also support a [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md), because comparisons often lead to a low feeling of [self worth](/notes/self-worth.md), that we would always fail to compare and would never reach their level of success, while also being blind to the effort they have put to be where they are now.

Comparing yourself to others is the worst kind of comparison. It's not comparing apples to apples, we would never be them, even if we walk down the same path. We have different circumstances, different worldviews, and mostly different [unique skills](/notes/skill-synthesis.md).

To compare yourself to others is to become a slave to [Jealousy](/notes/jealousy.md), instead of being [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md) about your life. Don't ask what you don't have, focus on what you can do now to be better, and reflect on how far you've come from who you were in the past.
