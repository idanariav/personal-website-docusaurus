# First Batch Trash

## Notes

Most of our "first tries" are low quality and need revision/editing at the bare minimum, if not a complete do-over. Being an [expert](/notes/mastery.md) reduces the gap, but it still exists. This goes to show that we can't avoid [Failure](/notes/failure.md) and that a [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md) will be a self-fulfilling prophecy if we always stop on the first try.

Improvement is a [process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), not a [one time](/notes/binary-thinking.md) investment, and we have to accept that we first must start at a low point to achieve a worthy level of quality. This is an avoidable step of the process [upfront costs](/notes/upfront-costs.md). We also have to consider that we can't achieve mastery by studying theory alone, that [deliberate practice](/notes/deliberate-practice.md) is the best way of improving, and that it requires [experience knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md) to complete our understanding of the topic. A musician who never draws is not a musician.

What allows us to improve from one iteration to another is [feedback](/notes/feedback.md). By seeing what we did wrong, and perhaps getting help from a [mentor](/notes/mentor.md), we could learn from our mistakes and do better next time.
