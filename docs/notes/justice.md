# Justice

## Notes

Justice is the concept of basic rights and obligations that moral agents are entitled to, simply due to the fact that they exist. These can be humans, but also animals, nature, etc. Usually, this is a passive obligation, such as to not be harmed, or not be discriminated against.  Justice rarely requires of us to be active in order to maintain it, at least by individuals. 

However, there might be different levels of justice. For example, a country's obligation towards it's citizens is higher than it's obligation towards members of different states.
