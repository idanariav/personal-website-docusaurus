# Holistic

## Notes

Looking at something holistically means to observe the whole as a whole, rather than as individual parts [Reductionism](/notes/reductionism.md). It is to assume that certain properties are [emergent](/notes/emergence.md), that stem from the interactions between components, that would have otherwised be ignored or missing whenchecking each component separatly. 

For example, the "cure" for headaches can vary greatly depending on what we are trying to cure. A more simplistic approach would be to treat the symptomes, giving them pills for the pain. A more holistic approach would be to see what the cause of the pain is, knowing that it might not even be physical. Mental and emotional states are highly influential on our physical state [Mind-body connection](/notes/mind-body-connection.md).

Usually a holistic approach tries to see the person as a complete, complex whole. It means to acknowledge that people are [multi faceted](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), that [reasons](/notes/intention.md) and [Context](/notes/context.md) matter as much and even more than the behavior itself, and that the person way to help a person is by making them help themselves, to work [with them](/notes/cooperation.md) rather than [against](/notes/binary-thinking.md) them.
