# Rest

## Notes

Rest is all about letting your body and mind the chance to recharge. We are not capable of endless [Focus](/notes/focus.md) and productivity. Same as [Sleep](/notes/sleep.md) is essential for our wellbeing, so does rest. Rest doesn't mean necessarily to take a nap, but it has to be a chance where we intentionally don't focus on anything in particular, where we clear our [Working Memory](/notes/working-memory.md), enabling us to also activate our [Downtime brain](/notes/downtime-brain.md).It also helps us avoid [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md)

Usually rest also allows us to [slow down](/notes/slowing-down.md) and [reflect](/notes/introspection.md) on the events of our lives, taking a step [back](/notes/zoom-out.md), and to looking at things with more [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md). It also helps us avoid cases of [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md), where we are prone to respond automatically to a situation rather than choosing how to [react](/notes/agency.md) to it.

Rest gives us back the power we need in order to act according to who we want to be, in an efficient way. It is not a waste of time, rather one of the best uses of our time, a [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md) for our productivity. It is something worth protecting, especially from ourselves and our desire to [do it all](/notes/hustle-culture.md)
