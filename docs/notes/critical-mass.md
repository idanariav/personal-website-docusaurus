# Critical Mass

## Notes

Change is often [non linear](/notes/non-linear.md), its often only once we reach a certain [threshold](/notes/threshold-bias.md) that a change occurs. For example, escaping [Path Dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md) is difficult, it takes a critical mass of people/annoyance in order to gather the energy and will to do something about it.

This means that as long as our [Defaults](/notes/defaults.md) are not too costly, we won't do anything to change them. If I only binge for an hour a day, perhaps it's fine, but I assume that once you reach the 6+ hours a day threshold most of us would try to quit TV.
