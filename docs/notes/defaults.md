# Defaults

## Notes

Defaults are a very powerful tool for decision making, because most often people tend to stick to the default option, if such exist, or a no-choice option, if no default is present. This could be due to:
1. **Lack of awareness** - we are not aware the power defaults have on us, or that we do have a better option. [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md)
2. **Ambivalence** - we don't care which option to choose, so might as well stick to the default [Indifference](/notes/indifference.md)
3. **Low friction** - by being the default, it often involves [Friction](/notes/friction.md) to switch to a different option, which makes it so much harder to choose otherwise [Saying no](/notes/saying-no.md).
4. **Exhaustion** - Since making a good choice requires willpower, which is a [limited](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md) resource, we can't rely on it to constantly save us from defaults. When we are [exhausted](/notes/burnout.md), we are much more likely to follow with the default behavior rather than making a better choice.
5. **Emotional instability** - Defaults are usually [tempting](/notes/procrastination.md), which means we need [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md) to combat the urge to stick with it.

Defaults can be good or bad, depending on the default choice. Unfortunately, the [Attention Economy](/notes/attention-economy.md) pushes us towards negative defaults such as doom scrolling. However, we can [design](/notes/nudge.md) an environment with good defaults, for example using [Commitment Devices](/notes/commitment-devices.md) that turns the good behavior into the default one, such as using an automated transfer into savings account every month.
