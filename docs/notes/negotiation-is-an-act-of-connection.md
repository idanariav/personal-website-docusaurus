# Negotiation is an Act of Connection

## Notes

Negotiation is an act of connection, by this I mean that **every attempt to reach an agreement with someone else requires us to communicate**. That sounds obvious but the main point is that it's not a war to strategize, but rather we must understand that we are dealing with another human being, with thoughts, emotions, and preferences. It requires [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md) and also realize that it is a two way process, and will likely require us to expose ourselves, to put ourselves on the line. It requires [Honesty](/notes/honesty.md) and [Vulnerability](/notes/vulnerability.md). Only by realizing this holistic picture of negotiations, could we be able to find [win win situations](/notes/win-win-situations.md).
