# Compatibilism

## Notes

Compatibilism is the believe that we can coincide [Determinism](/notes/determinism.md) with free will. Perhaps it works on different levels, for example having a determined physical world for inanimate objects, but a free world for thinking beings. 

The most common form of compatibilism is the "reasons view", according to it - **you're not to blame for doing the wrong thing, but is responsible for doing the right thing because free will is the ability to follow the right reasons.** [Intention](/notes/intention.md)
To follow the right reasons doesn't mean following them blindly, like a child that doesn't still because he was told not to. It requires [introspection](/notes/introspection.md) [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md), deep thinking and understanding what those reasons are and why they exist.

i.e good deeds won't come out of sticking with [Defaults](/notes/defaults.md) or acting mindlessly, but rather identifying the good in the world and making an active choice to pursue them [Agency](/notes/agency.md). Bad deeds however are often the result of forfeiting our will [Objectivity](/notes/objectivity.md), not necessarily because we want to do evil [Hanlon's Razor](/notes/hanlons-razor.md), but just "forced to" by society, laziness or ignorance [free will is knowledge](/notes/free-will-is-knowledge.md) .
