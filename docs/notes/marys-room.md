# Mary's room

## Notes

Mary's room is a [thought experiment](/notes/simulations.md)] that demonstrates the existence of [experience knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md). In this experiment, imagine a scientist who lives in a black-and-white room, with all the relevant information about the color red. The biology of how our eyes process color, about the physics of wave lengths, about products that are usually red, everything, but all of that is in black-and-white.

Then, she is allowed to step outside and sees red for the first time. The question is, does Mary now knows more than she knew before existing the room? if we say yes, we acknowledge that some knowledge can only be gained through experience, that there is a difference between the details of a phenomenon, and the conscious experience of it [the hard problem of consciousness](/notes/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness.md)
