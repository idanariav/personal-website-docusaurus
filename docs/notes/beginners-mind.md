# Beginner's Mind

## Notes

Beginner's mind is a mental state, similar to [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md), where we are open to new ideas, love learning in a non-[judgmental](/notes/judgment.md) way. We tend to [Explore](/notes/testing.md) in a [playful](/notes/gamification.md) way. To be in a beginner's mind is one of the most helpful ways to maintain a [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) and a [Lifelong Learning](/notes/lifelong-learning.md) mentality. We are forever a student, ready to expand our knowledge from everyone we meet and everything we do.

It's not easy to be in this state, especially for extended periods of time. It requires [Humility](/notes/humility.md), to admit that we still have much to learn [Over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md). It also requires us to escape the [Curse of Knowledge](/notes/curse-of-knowledge.md), to somehow not let previous knowledge hold us back from learning new things, to think that we already know everything, or to lose the curiosity that comes from being a novice. We are not [attached](/notes/attachment.md) to our existing knowledge, and we embrace the [scientific method](/notes/scientific-method.md) as a method of exploration, accepting that we will be wrong, but in the process of setting hypothesis and testing them, we will get closer to the truth.
