# Veil of Ignorance

## Notes
according to John Rawls, the way we should build or act within a society is according to the *maximin principle*, which is - we should choose the world in which the situation of the persons worst off is the highest it can be. [Pareto Principle](/notes/pareto-principle.md).

In contrast, this doesn't necessarily means we should be egalitarian, since equality could make everyone worse off, compared to [Capitalism](/notes/capitalism.md) where you have huge inequality, but even the poor are better off than a [Communism](/notes/communism.md) country.

This is the only logical conclusion that we should make when making decisions behind the *veil of ignorance*, i.e making the decision without knowing who you'd turn up to be in that society. [Morality is both rational and emotional](/notes/morality-is-both-rational-and-emotional.md)
