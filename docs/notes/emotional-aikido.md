# Emotional Aikido

## Notes

Aikido is the art of using the opponents strength against him, to use his [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md) as his downfall, as they say "the bigger they are, the harder they fall". For example, when an opponent is running towards you, what is easier? to try and stop him, or to move aside and make him trip? Emotional aikido is very similar, but deals with our emotions instead.

When we feel [Fear](/notes/fear.md), [Stress](/notes/stress.md), [Anger](/notes/anger.md), [Jealousy](/notes/jealousy.md) , what is easier? to try and suppress these emotions, bury them deep inside and hoping they will never come out? Or, is it easier to use them as our inner fuel for becoming a better person.

Suppressing emotions is not only a wishful thinking, it's harmful. Suppressed emotions either lead to [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md) when we can't hold them back anymore, erupting like a volcano that hurts us and those closest to us, or they could eat us from the inside, often leading to [Depression](/notes/depression.md). We can't ignore our emotions away, but also - why should we?

Emotions are not a random, weird by-product of evolution. They have always been a tool that helps us take action [Emotions as decision heuristics](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md). Each emotion can become a source of [energy](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md), if we know how to tap it. Using the energy emotions provide us, we can turn negative situations into moments of [Proactiveness](/notes/proactiveness.md).

The main way of tapping the energy emotions bring is through [reframing](/notes/framing.md) the situation from backwards looking (why has this happened), to forward looking (what can I do about it). For example, if you are angry at your boss, use this anger either to try to make a change in your current job (fixing what's bugging you), or bring you strength for the exhausting process of finding a new job. If you are afraid of failure, understand exactly what frightens you - these are your weak points that you have to work on the most.
If you are envy of someone else, learn how they got to where they are so that you could imitate their process and advance as well. To understand which emotion you are experiencing, and how you can convert it to something positive requires [Introspection](/notes/introspection.md)
