# Transferred Learning

## Notes

Transferred Learning is the ability to [use](/notes/imitation.md) knowledge from one case to another. This is essentially the entire meaning of learning, because otherwise the knowledge you have gathered is very limited in it's usability. In essence, the more [Connections](/notes/coherentism.md) we make, the more [bridges](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md) we build that will allow us to transfer knowledge from one area to another.

Aside from the connections themselves, this also means that the information itself has become somewhat [independent](/notes/medium-independent.md) of the source from which it was learned, that we were able to [extract](/notes/distillment.md) it's essence. Transferred learning also provides us with [Flexability](/notes/adaptability.md), because having useful knowledge from different areas gives us more ways of thinking about the same problems.

**The more narrow sense is implementing the same knowledge in similar cases**. For example, does your high school math actually prepares you for math problems you will encounter in real life? If not, then the way or the content you were taught is not transferrable.

**The broader sense is transferring knowledge between fields**. For example using knowledge from economics on how to facilitate communication between computers. In that case, your economic knowledge is highly transferrable.

Usually, **knowledge is more transferrable the more it provides you with understanding of the logic, method and processes underlying it** instead of just memorization of facts [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md) [Engagement](/notes/engagement.md).

Transferred learning benefits from [Range](/notes/breath-beats-depth.md), the more knowledgeable we are in different fields, the more likely we are to find ways of transferring knowledge from one area to another. Therefore range has a [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md) effect on our knowledge, because the amount of potential links between ideas and fields grows exponentially, and not linearly, the more information we gather.


It can be our source of [Skill synthesis](/notes/skill-synthesis.md), the unique combination of knowledge we posses.

It can also be perceived as a type of creative thinking, because combining knowledge from different domains is one of the best ways of bringing something new to life.
