# Negative Freedom

## Notes

Negative freedom means the freedom from [dependencies](/notes/dependency.md) and [Limits](/notes/limits.md). For example, we don't have negative freedom when we are put in jail. Our movement, our lifestyle, how we spend our time is restricted. Similarly, taxes can be conceived as something that harms our negative freedom because reduces our financial freedom.

Negative freedom is like "freedom from", we want to break the shackles that holds us back so that we could do whatever we want. This is different from [Positive freedom](/notes/positive-freedom.md) that focuses on "freedom to", the ability to pursue and fulfill goals and dreams.

Usually negative freedom is [visible](/notes/visibility.md), that are concrete laws, regulations and actions done against you that limit your available actions.
