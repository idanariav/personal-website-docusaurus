# Consistency

## Notes

Consistency is often an undervalued virtue because it is not as bright or exciting as others. Consistency is not the embodiment of [excellence](/notes/competence.md), yet it is an excellence maker [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md).

When we do something consistently, we are much more likely to improve at it because:
1. **Practice is key** - we know that [practice beats perfection](/notes/practice-beats-perfection.md), the more we try to do something, the better we are at it.
2. **It brings momentum** - doing something repeatably creates [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md), having a good streak creates a self reinforcing loop that helps us continue with it. With time, it can also become a [habit](/notes/habit-formation.md)
3. **It brings stability** - We are creatures of habit, so our habits become part of who we are, which means we are much more likely to [stick](/notes/stability.md) with them despite external changes, and even after goals are reached which often lead to a neglection of our [progress](/notes/trust-the-process.md).

However, as with most cases of consistency, we have to be [patient](/notes/patience.md) until we can see the fruits of our labor, and might require [Grit](/notes/grit.md) in order to maintain our behavior despite having little to show for at the beginning.

Consistency has an additional benefit because it makes us reliable. First for ourselves, because once we get into the habit of doing the same thing repeatably, we have less [Decision points](/notes/decision-points.md) to make. Like a person that goes every day to the gym, they don't have to decide each morning whether to go to the gym or not. They know that they have to do it every day. Similarly, it makes us more [trustworthy](/notes/trust.md), because people know they can count on us to do something because we are consistent with it. They don't have to worry that we might forget or abandon the task.
