# Amor Fati

## Notes

Amor fati means to love one's fate, is not only to [accept](/notes/acceptance.md) where you are currently in your life, but by joyful for it, to agree to having your life repeated exactly as is, with all your triumphs and moments of sadness as well. 

Amor fati stems from knowing that you have done your best, you have tried as best as you can, so there is no reason for you to feel ashamed of your life, but rather embrace your destiny. 

It is to embrace discomfort and transform it into a necessary component of existence rather than a source of misery.
