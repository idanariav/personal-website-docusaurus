# Manifesting

## Notes

Manifesting is when we try to impose our beliefs onto the world, instead of matching our views based on how the world is right now [Acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md). On the one hand, it opposes [is vs ought](/notes/is-vs-ought.md), we don't surrender our thinking to the [Path Dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md) of reality, it is not limited by how things are or base our beliefs on false justification just because "that's the way it is" [Status-quo bias](/notes/status-quo-bias.md). Additionally, to manifest is like the mental equivalent of [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md), by saying to ourselves "I will have a great day" or "I will get the success I deserve", we set the stage for those things to happen.

However, manifesting is problematic due to several reasons:
1. **Nativity** - there's often a distinction between thinking and doing, when we focus on manifesting rather than [Proactiveness](/notes/proactiveness.md), we naively think that manifesting is enough. Instead of "I will have a great day", we need to ask ourselves "how can I make my day great"
2. **Entitlement** - sometimes manifesting leads us to think that we already have it in the bag, or that we deserve as a matter of "promised " it [Future disillusionment](/notes/future-disillusionment.md). We set our [expectations](/notes/expectations.md) way too high, we become [attached](/notes/attachment.md) to this reality that doesn't yet exist, which could lead to [Disappointment](/notes/disappointment.md) when life doesn't go our way.
