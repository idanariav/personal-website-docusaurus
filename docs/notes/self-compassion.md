# Self-compassion

## Notes

Self compassion as the name implies is to be kind to yourself, which might sound obvious but we often forget how we can be our own worst [critic](/notes/self-criticism.md). It means to treat yourself with compassion, as if you were [talking](/notes/self-talk.md) to your friend who is having a bad time. However, it doesn't mean you should shut down your criticizing self, only to be it's friend. Our emotions and thoughts are important, and shouldn't be ignored or dismissed. Emotions aren't good or bad, they are a type of [information](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md), a piece of a puzzle, not the whole picture.

Be your own ally. Having yourself as an ally is like having a [Safe Base](/notes/safe-base.md), you become your own safe place, giving you [energy](/notes/standing-up-for-yourself.md) to venture out into the world with [Confidence](/notes/self-worth.md). By being kind to yourself, you strengthen your self worth. It also helps when you [affirm](/notes/self-affirmation.md) your values, remembering who you are and what you are trying to do and to be, even if we fail along the way.

Remember that the more you [accept](/notes/validation.md) yourself, the more you can change. That's why self-compassion is the true key for having a [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md). You don't have to change in order to be worthy, you want to change because you care about yourself. Being harsh/beating yourself up is not the best way to improve on the long run. Similarly, self compassion is how we turn [failure](/notes/scientific-method.md) in [growth](/notes/creative-destruction.md), because it helps us see the lesson behind it, instead of a permeant stain on who we are, or a proof that we can't change.
