# Happiness is to Be Virtuous

## Notes

Happiness consists in living a good life. It’s about having a good and morally consistent character [virtue theory](/notes/virtue-theory.md)

The only kind of power that really matters is the power you have over yourself, not the power you have over other people, things or resources. [Stoicism](/notes/stoicism.md) [Acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md) The ultimate goal of life is simply that you should know yourself, as a human being who has tried to become excellent in some way. [introspection](/notes/introspection.md) You may never attain total mastery of what you set out to do, but it is better to try than not make the attempt at all. It doesn’t matter if things unravel. 

The point about ethics is not that you prosper as we understand what it is to prosper in this world. The important thing is that you hold yourself together as a human being with integrity, courage and principles, so that you are the kind of person who cannot be forced to do evil. [to be moral is to act moral](/notes/to-be-moral-is-to-act-moral.md)

To Aristotle, **happiness is the end of all means, it cannot be a mean in of itself** [Intrinsic](/notes/intrinsic.md). For example, if you think wealth will make you happy, Aristotle cautions you're wrong. After all, when you pursue wealth, what you really want is not wealth, it's what wealth can buy.

Therefore, the true measure of happiness is not our emotions, but by how well you are using your rationality, and for Aristotle, using your rationality means finding the "golden mean" between two extremes, that's where virtue lies [Balance Extremes](/notes/balance-extremes.md). Each kind of virtue is a mean between some excessive tendency and a tendency towards deficiency 

The way it connects to happiness is when we will take pleasure in doing what is right, when we are used to doing the right thing. [Love what is good](/notes/love-what-is-good.md)

Virtue is knowledge [free will is knowledge](/notes/free-will-is-knowledge.md), and therefore, in life, the most important and beneficial thing for you is your education (which shapes your character) [Akrasia](/notes/akrasia.md)
