# Transparency

## Notes

Transparency means to be open and forthcoming, it requires [Proactiveness](/notes/proactiveness.md) to not only not hide the truth, but actively display it and be truthful with your peer. It requires [Honesty](/notes/honesty.md) because it is not always easy to tell the truth, but when we are transparent, it is much easier to communicate, for others to understand us, and to avoid misconceptions on what is happening and way. Transparency is the first step to [Inclusion](/notes/inclusion.md), and to bridge the gap created by the [Theory of Mind](/notes/theory-of-mind.md).

When we are transparent, we are much more likely to generate [trust](/notes/trust.md), people know we are reliable because we are completely [open](/notes/visibility.md) with them, no hidden motives. Every one is aware of our [Intention](/notes/intention.md) and [Incentives](/notes/incentives.md).

Sometimes, trying to be transparent brings [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md) to ourselves, by trying to communicate our thoughts and intentions, we start to understand ourselves better as well [introspection](/notes/introspection.md) [Feynman Technique](/notes/feynman-technique.md).
