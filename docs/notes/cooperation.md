# Cooperation

## Notes

Cooperation is the method by which we achieve [Win win situations](/notes/win-win-situations.md), it is part of our nature to cooperate [People are inherently good](/notes/humans-are-good-as-default.md), but we are known for being selectively cooperative. Usually it is only within our group to make sure we filter out [free riders](/notes/free-rider.md) and others who uses our cooperation for their benefit only [Us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md).

Cooperation enables us to overcome [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md) that is too large for an individual to face, and uses shared intelligence, resources and viewpoints to bring a solution [Peer support](/notes/peer-support.md). Cooperation is also useful when each focuses on their own [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md), offering what they do best while others provide what you are lacking.

Cooperation requires a degree of [Humility](/notes/humility.md), to recognize that you don't always know best, or that you can't do everything by yourself. It requires you to [listen](/notes/active-listening.md) to the other side and understand them, to know what they need and how you can bring a shared solution, rather than treating them as the problem. [People are not the problem](/notes/people-are-not-the-problem.md)

Cooperation is also a matter of culture. For example, an organization with [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md) and [Kindness](/notes/giving.md) as the expected behavior, will have a much easier time creating moments of cooperation [Ripple effect](/notes/ripple-effect.md).
