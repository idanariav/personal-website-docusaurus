# Boundaries

## Notes

Boundaries are our linguistic [skin](/notes/filtering.md). It is our first layer of filtering out incoming stimulus. By setting boundaries, we [limit](/notes/limits.md) the kind of communication and behavior that is [expected](/notes/expectations.md) to us and from us. .Since [We can't read minds](/notes/theory-of-mind.md), setting boundaries is actually a way to strengthen [Relationships](/notes/relationships.md) because we remove the [Ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md) and increase the [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md) of what is expected from each other. We have less of a guessing game, and more chances to act the way that the other wants to, improving their well being and ours. It's a [Win win situations](/notes/win-win-situations.md), where both sides are better off.

Many times, when we find ourselves [frustrated](/notes/blame.md) or angry when communicating with others, whether it is anger towards others or ourselves, it is usually due to a lack of boundary. If only we would have mentioned our preferences, for example how something makes us feel which is why we don't want it to happen again, or what is our preferred method/time to communicate about certain issues. Boundaries force us to be more [transparent](/notes/transparency.md).

Sometimes, we believe we don't need boundaries because we believe that they other side has the same preferences as us, which usually leads to [Disappointment](/notes/disappointment.md). We must remember that everyone has it's own [perspective](/notes/subjective-reality.md).
