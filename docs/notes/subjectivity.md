# Subjectivity

## Notes

Subjectivity is an a sense to be a pure ideal, something moldable, a potential, a [force](/notes/will-to-power.md), imbued with meaning, a living value. To be a subject or to be seen as such, is to be a conscious human being, with moral responsibility for their actions, and with [Moral worth](/notes/moral-worth.md). We are not [objects](/notes/objectivity.md) to be used by others, nor are we fixed, shallow and can be easily quantify.

Often, people with [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) are at least in some part a subject, because they recognize their capability to [transcend](/notes/transcendence.md), to grow and [adapt](/notes/adaptability.md). They are [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md) in their lives, operating from a place of [Agency](/notes/agency.md).

Sometimes it happens that we [lose](/notes/lost-in-the-finite.md) ourselves to that ideal. For example workaholics, or political actives, that see no difference between their lives and the goal they are working for. While in these cases it seems that we are embodying an ideal, we are actually becoming a slave to an external ideal, becoming an object that they control. To live an ideal has to empower us, and not just the ideal itself. It is to find a [Synergy](/notes/win-win-situations.md) between the life we want, and who we are, to be happy, to prosper and to nurture ourselves while pursuing who we wish to be.
