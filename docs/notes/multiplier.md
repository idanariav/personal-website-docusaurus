# Multiplier

## Notes

A multiplier is a tool that enhances existing habits and behaviors, in a way that improves the action's effectiveness. For example, a shovel is a multiplier for digging, as is a car for transportation. True, it can be done in other means, but these tools make the task much easier [Friction](/notes/friction.md) and more effective. Therefore, we shouldn't just focus on the tasks inputs and outputs (i.e our efforts and results), but also the tools we use and how they can improve us [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md).

Multipliers shine when combined with [compounding](/notes/compounding.md). Since most habits and actions have a compounding effect with time, an early start with the help of multipliers will have a tremendous effect in the future. Multipliers can also help you develop your [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md), by using multipliers wisely you can advance faster than others, being more proficient with the same resources.

While each field can have it's own multipliers, there are global multipliers that we should cultivate or preserve:
1. **Physical multipliers** - [Sleep](/notes/sleep.md) is a good multiplier, because our cognitive capacity and energy levels are dependent on it.
2. **Emotional multipliers** - Approaching life with [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md) and cultivating [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) for what we do allows us to tap energy that is usually reserved for things that interest us, while also fueling us with a desire to preform well.
3. **Mental multipliers** - having a [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md), the belief that we can improve our skills is key. With the right mindset, we can achieve much more than we could otherwise. Similarly, having [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md) can help us stay on track and not be led astray by internal and external distractions.
4. **Technical multipliers** - Structuring the task such that we will be able to achieve a sense of [Flow](/notes/flow.md) while performing it is a huge multiplier for our efficiency.

However, the multiplier effect can also have negative consequences. For example, [Stress](/notes/stress.md) is a negative multiplier, because whenever we are stressed our efficiency drops, no matter how hard we try (or perhaps because of it).
