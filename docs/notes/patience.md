# Patience

## Notes

To be patient is perhaps one of the hardest things to master as humans. resisting [Temptations](/notes/procrastination.md) is perhaps against our biological tendencies. Especially as [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) goes up, our tendency for [Present Bias](/notes/present-bias.md) is stronger, which makes patience all the more difficult.

However, regardless of the circumstances, we must remember that we always have the [Freedom of response](/notes/agency.md). Nothing can force us to act in a certain way, only to push us towards doing so, it's we who choose how to act. Usually, unless we live in a constant state of high uncertainty, we can be relatively certain that patience is a worthwhile effort. When we choose to wait, knowing something better lies ahead, we can be more relaxed, knowing that being [stressed](/notes/stress.md) in that moment serves no purpose [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md).

Patience, more than being a skill that is based on [Self-control](/notes/self-control.md), is rather based on [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md). Since it's our emotions that try to impact our decisions the most, whether it's the urge to fall for temptations, or stressing about what might happen, it's only when we learn to balance ourselves that we can resist them and choose differently.

Being patient also means that we don't rush things, that we are aware that some things takes time to develop, and by rushing it we might lead to a worse outcome, like harvesting before the fruits are ripe [Slowing down](/notes/slowing-down.md). It's to resist the urge of urgency, that if we won't act now we might miss the opportunity, while actually in most cases acting immediately gives too much power to [Noise](/notes/noise.md) that seems urgent, that would have disappeared if we just waited.
