# Consumerism

## Notes

To keep the economic machine rolling, we need to have both aspects - production and consumption. (Jump:: [[Capitalism]]) "takes care" of the production side, while consumerism takes care of the consumption side. If one leg falls, they both fall.

Consumerism means that we focus on the (Jump:: [[Scarcity|lack]]) in our lives, and how (Aka:: [[shining new thing|new things]]) could potentially fill that gap. However, this is not a one-time solution. If we were to make a single purchase and be satisfied for life, the economy would crumble. It requires constant consumption. That's why consumerism leads to the psychological phenomena:
1. **Constant hunger for more** - What we have is never enough, we can never be satisfied with what we have, and the only way to solve our problems is to have more things (Related:: [[Future disillusionment]]). Since new inventions keep on coming and products wear and tear over time, we constantly have to replace them (Opposes:: [[Happiness is contentment]]). We become machines of (Jump:: [[Desire]]).
2. **Happiness is having** - We no longer determine what makes us happy. The (Aka:: [[Social Environment|economy]]) bombards us with messages that happiness is a matter of possession, and no other forms are acceptable. We fall pry to (Jump:: [[shallow copy]]) of happiness.
