# Consumerism

## Notes

To keep the economic machine rolling, we need to have both aspects - production and consumption. [Capitalism](/notes/capitalism.md) "takes care" of the production side, while consumerism takes care of the consumption side. If one leg falls, they both fall.

Consumerism means that we focus on the [lack](/notes/scarcity.md) in our lives, and how [new things](/notes/shining-new-thing.md) could potentially fill that gap. However, this is not a one-time solution. If we were to make a single purchase and be satisfied for life, the economy would crumble. It requires constant consumption. That's why consumerism leads to the psychological phenomena:
1. **Constant hunger for more** - What we have is never enough, we can never be satisfied with what we have, and the only way to solve our problems is to have more things [Future disillusionment](/notes/future-disillusionment.md). Since new inventions keep on coming and products wear and tear over time, we constantly have to replace them [Happiness is contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md). We become machines of [Desire](/notes/desire.md).
2. **Happiness is having** - We no longer determine what makes us happy. The [economy](/notes/social-environment.md) bombards us with messages that happiness is a matter of possession, and no other forms are acceptable. We fall pry to [shallow copy](/notes/shallow-copy.md) of happiness.
