# Saying no

## Notes

Saying no to something is saying yes to something else, and vice versa, because time and energy are [limited](/notes/scarcity.md), do every decision we make has an [Alternative cost](/notes/alternative-cost.md). Committing to work more leaves less time for your family. Doing too much will cause [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md). Scheduling all your time prevents spontaneous and flexibility.

By saying no, we free time, mental power, money and motivation for the more important things. By committing to less, we can do more [Addition by subtraction](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md). We tend to over commit because our future is less [tangible](/notes/visibility.md) than our current self, we naievly believe that we will have more time in the future, or that future us will be able to withstand these commitments, even if currently we are unable to. It's a form of [Present Bias](/notes/present-bias.md) that we push commitments further to the future, while protecting our current self.

Alternatively, we over commit because we don't want to disappoint others [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md). We wish to meet their [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) of us, so we say yes, even if internally we wish to say no.

Either way, saying no is a form of [Authenticity](/notes/authenticity.md), it is to align our actions with our self, to live according to our preferences and not others.. Additionally, saying no prevents you from asking yourself later on [When to Quit](/notes/when-to-quit.md), which is a much [harder](/notes/path-dependence.md) decision to make than to say no in the first place.
