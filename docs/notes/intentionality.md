# Intentionality

## Notes

a lot of the challenges we are facing today as modern humans is because we lack intentionality in our actions. our time is spent [automatically](/notes/defaults.md), without [Agency](/notes/agency.md), being swept by the winds of external or internal [stimulus](/notes/procrastination.md), controlled by forced who try to do just that, such as [social media](/notes/attention-economy.md), tv, etc... we stick to the default settings in life, even when a good option is right next door.

To be intentional, to be mindful of our actions requires [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md). It is to do things from the right reasons, to pay attention while we are performing them. Often, to achieve mindfulness we need to take a [Break](/notes/rest.md), to pause and [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md), to spend our attention on what we do currently, instead of letting the mind wander. It is said that [Meditation](/notes/meditation.md) is a good practice for increasing our mindfulness, forcing us to focus on our body and the present moment is a useful tool to have in our lives.

Mindfulness is also useful against [Stress](/notes/stress.md), instead of falling pray to harmful thoughts, we see them for what they are, just thoughts, not necessary a part of our identity, and they come as they go. Same goes for [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md). Thoughts and emotions often last just 60-90 seconds. If we can maintain our calmness what emotions are running high, we can quickly recover when they pass [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md).
