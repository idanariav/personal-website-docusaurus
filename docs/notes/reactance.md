# Reactance

## Notes

Reactance is when we "rebel" against something, often contrary to the [wishes](/notes/expectations.md) of the one who asked. For example when you see a "please don't litter" sign, and in response you purposefully throws something on the ground. While it appears purposefully, it is not always intentional. It might be an [automatic](/notes/defaults.md) response as any other, although it is often occurs when we feel we lose our [freedom of choice](/notes/agency.md). It also happens when we are treated as [objects](/notes/objectivity.md), when we are not seen or understood.

**When we experience it as being pushed, we will push back** [The law of reverse effect](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md). Reactance is dangerous because it pushes us towards a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md), where our reactance causes reactance on the other side as well, promoting [Zero sum](/notes/binary-thinking.md) thinking, strengthens an [Me vs them](/notes/agent-vs-society-moralism.md) mindset, and reduces [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md).

Therefore [Framing](/notes/framing.md) is key, because what causes reactance is not so much the request itself but rather how we perceive it. The difference between "Littering is prohibited and you will be fined" is very different from "please help us protect our neighborhood and keep it clean" although the request is de facto the same.
