# Anger

## Notes

As with similar "negative" emotions, anger can be an expression of dissatisfaction with the way things are. Either the way we behave, or others, it is a step of recognition, that something can be better [Emotions as information](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md).
The question is what will we do with the anger, will we use it to become better [Forward thinking](/notes/forward-thinking.md), to do better, or will it result in lashing out, hurting others and ourselves which will only perpetuate the unjust situation and cause us to be filled with [Guilt](/notes/guilt.md) and [Regret](/notes/regret.md).

Often, when we are mad we use [Emotional Projection](/notes/emotional-projection.md), expressing anger towards others when we are actually mad at ourselves [Emotional Projection](/notes/emotional-projection.md).

Anger can also be an expression of [Inequality](/notes/inequality.md), a feeling of injustice, but can also be related to feelings of [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md). After all, if we could do something about it and resolve the situation, what's the point in being angry about it?

Anger can also lead to [Impulsivity](/notes/impulsivity.md) where we lose ourselves to the emotion, acting without noticing.
