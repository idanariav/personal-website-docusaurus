# surf the urge

## Notes

Most of our emotional experiences are short lived, especially strong cases of [Desire](/notes/desire.md). Feeling the urge to fall for [Temptations](/notes/procrastination.md) is actually very short. However, it gets stronger and longer the more we try to resist it [The law of reverse effect](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md).

By accepting the emotion, by letting ourselves experience it without [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) yet without acting on it either, we "surf the urge", we let it express itself for the 30-60 seconds that it lasts, until it is over as if it didn't exist in the first place. That's how [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md) can be a better tool for handling temptations rather than willpower.

It is also useful in cases where we are about to lose control, like with the [F-it effect](/notes/f-it-effect.md). Letting our emotions express themselves without acting on it can help us avoid doing things we might regret.
