# No Pain no Gain

## Notes

Sometimes we see [effort](/notes/struggle.md) as a virtue, that achievements in life or having good things necessarily involves effort, so we assume that if we are not working hard, we won't achieve anything. If something is [simple](/notes/simplicity.md), or god forbid [fun](/notes/gamification.md), then it won't lead us anywhere.

The problem is that it often leads us to [Goodhart’s Law](/notes/goodhart’s-law.md), where we focus on the effort as the metric for success, instead of our progress/outcome. We suffer for the sake of suffering, regardless of the output. We think that by suffering more, we will achieve more success, as if it is a direct link.

If I could have the same level of outputs with less inputs, less struggle and energy, why shouldn't I? Taking "shortcuts" or doing things "smarter" is not a vice, it is exactly the thing that will help us achieve what we wanted, and bypass competitors. [Reverse Thinking](/notes/reverse-thinking.md)
