# Counterfactual

## Notes

The counterfactual is a collection of all the things that are not "real", but perhaps could have been. For example, to think about the results of the decisions you didn't make means to think about the counterfactual.

It's a form of complex [predictions](/notes/prediction.md) because it requires us to think about a future that is not a direct continuation of the current situation as it is (which is hard enough), but rather create a prediction based on a different set of facts.

It's very [hard](/notes/complexity.md), to say the least, it is the least [visible](/notes/visibility.md) idea there is, because it is by definition not tied to current facts. It requires being open minded and with [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md).

You might ask what is the usefulness of something that doesn't exist? Thinking about the counterfactual is the best way for us to evaluate our decisions in a broader context, considering for example the [Alternative cost](/notes/alternative-cost.md) and our role in the grand schema of things.

For example, although it sounds clear and obvious, the logic behind [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md) is about exploring the counterfactual - "If you would have done x instead of y, you would have gotten a better result". The [Pre-Mortem](/notes/pre-mortem.md) process shares this similarity, by trying to explore multiple potential outcomes (and not just the most likely one).
