# Stability

## Notes

Stability is an undervauled trait, like [Consistency](/notes/consistency.md). Nowadays we are much more prone to "go big or go home", not noticing that we trade off stability for growth. We over [optimize](/notes/optimization.md) every aspect of our lives which makes them less robust. The smallest change make cause the collapse of the entire system.

However, it's better to have a [anti fragile](/notes/anti-fragility.md) system than a "boom and bust" one. [Slowing down](/notes/slowing-down.md)Building a wide foundation, optimizing not the output but rather the process, the system, is what brings success in the long run [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md). As they say, "slow and steady wins the race". A stable system is an [adaptive](/notes/adaptability.md) one, one that is connected to the envioroment, not trying to ignore or replace it [Resonance](/notes/resonance.md).
