# Creative Destruction

## Notes

Creative destruction is the idea that progress is not a smooth linear line and small increments, but rather a cycle of destruction and reconstruction with large increments of improvements [Non linear](/notes/non-linear.md).
This term is originated from economics but is also relevant for other fields.

For example, cameras used film as its source of photography for many years, and this was the truth across the industry. The rise of the digital camera was not a small gradual change but rather a "violent" destruction of the industry that has changed it from side to side.

Creative destruction is also a synonym for natural selection, the idea that the old has to be destroyed, and is naturally destroyed, in the process of something new, better, stronger.

At the individual level, we can see such cases when a person wants or forced to change. Traumas or [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md) are moments where we feel like "[do or die](/notes/identity-discovery.md)", either having important realizations and [adapt](/notes/adaptability.md) to the situation, or we wither and fall into [Depression](/notes/depression.md). It is up to us to choose how to [react](/notes/agency.md) to a crisis. We can either surrender, let ourselves be crushed by these events, feeling [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md), blaming ourselves and the world. Or, we can take matter into our own hands, [embrace life](/notes/will-to-power.md) as it is, hardships and all, and believe that even painful events can lead to positive things [Happiness is an internal state](/notes/happiness-is-an-internal-state.md).

Unfortunately, as with other cases of creative destruction, this meaningful change can't come without paying the price of the destruction of the old [Layering](/notes/layering.md), that's why many people have epiphanies after near death situations, although the event itself didn't provide any new information, it just cleared the ground for something new to rise [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md). Some realizations can't be taught, they have to be [lived](/notes/experience-knowledge.md). These "lessons" are valuable, the most important lessons we can learn in our lifetimes, yet the are the hardest to learn. By training ourselves to embrace them, we can develop [Anti-Fragility](/notes/anti-fragility.md), where each crisis makes us stronger, it builds us, improves us, rather than tears us down.

Therefore, both at the societal and individual level, progress requires destruction. This doesn't mean that destruction is a desired thing nor that it is easy. Some events are truly awful, and the price can sometimes be too hard to bear. However, we have to be aware of the damage we do to ourselves by trying to avoid or eliminate these hardships. By embracing [Denial](/notes/denial.md), we at best [postpone](/notes/fixed-mindset.md) growth, and at worse we preserve a state of constant (perhaps small) suffering because we lack the courage to do what's necessary to overcome it. At the moment, overcoming has a high price compared to the low price of continued suffering, but in the long run the accumulative damage is much higher [Short term bias](/notes/present-bias.md). Even if we wanted to avoid hardships our whole lives, we would eventually be forced to face one, because [Life is change](/notes/life-is-change.md), and we can't protect ourselves from it, so better to face it head on, than trying to hide from it.
