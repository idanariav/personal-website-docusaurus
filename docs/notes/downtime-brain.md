# Downtime Brain

## Notes

"downtime brain", aka default mode network (or DMN). when we [Focus](/notes/focus.md), i.e commit our thinking to an external goal or action, then it is deactivated. However, **when we relax, our thinking turns inwards, which means the DMN is activated**. [Solitude](/notes/solitude.md). Expressions of that can be self reflection [introspection](/notes/introspection.md), day dreaming, processing of past events, [Planning](/notes/planning.md) for the future, social awareness, etc. This mode is critical for [creative thinking](/notes/ideation.md) and exploration of new ideas. It benefits from [Attention Residue](/notes/attention-residue.md), where we developed unfinished ideas "in the back burner", let them simmer, and perhaps discover new solutions or variations to the idea. Therefore, if you are experiencing [flow](/notes/flow.md), it is better to stop before you finish the task, such that you will continue to dive deeper into it in "downtime" mode. For example, if you are writing a book, stop in a cliffhanger, rather than on the end of the chapter.

This is in contrast with the [Executive Attention Network](/notes/executive-attention-network.md) (EAN), which is our "ram", it holds information in our [Working Memory](/notes/working-memory.md), it contains our "most frequent/obvious" responses to cases [Heuristics](/notes/heuristics.md), and our general strategy.

Usually, a creative process is dependent on the connection of the two. The downtime brain creates these ideas, while the EAN contextualize it, and brings it to life.
