# Our Mind is a Processor and not a Warehouse

## Notes

the human brain is very good at [generating](/notes/ideation.md) unique ideas, whether through combining subjects from previously unrelated sources, or by further developing an existing idea. In any case, we are not good at [storing](/notes/working-memory.md) these ideas. perhaps due to the [Attention Economy](/notes/attention-economy.md), or by being overloaded with [Task Switching](/notes/task-switching.md), it is costly and sometimes impossible to try and hold all of our thoughts and ideas in our heads.

Therefore once we finished "processing" a thought, we should save it somewhere external so we won't have to save it in our limited headspace with our limited [Focus](/notes/focus.md). It is the way to increase our creativity and our wellbeing..

If our mind is best at generating ideas and not keeping them, it means we need somewhere to store these ideas, and locate them when we need to. This is essentially the basis of a "second brain", using a digital copy to help us store our thoughts and ideas [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md)
