# Transcendence

## Notes

Transcendence is an act of becoming, of developing ourselves towards a better "version" of ourselves, of becoming an [idea](/notes/subjectivity.md), to aspire to be more, to do more, to treat ourselves as a [never ending](/notes/to-be-is-to-be-incomplete.md) project that on the one hand needs constant refining, but on the other hand bring satisfaction. It is a [process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), not a goal. It is the fulfillment and creation of our potential, it is to [live](/notes/authenticity.md) according to our [values](/notes/core-values.md) and practice virtues. It's about the journey, not the destination.

Transcendence requires many attributes in order for us not to fall off the path:
1. **Taking control** - [Grit](/notes/grit.md) gives us the determination to continue developing ourselves despite hardships. We don't believe that we are ;[fixed](/notes/fixed-mindset.md), we can change, we can grow, we can improve, and we have the [power](/notes/will-to-power.md) to [choose](/notes/agency.md) who we would become. We will [change](/notes/intertemporal-identity.md) over time, and we control the direction we are heading. 
2. **Self knowledge** - we must know ourselves, our thoughts and feelings otherwise we have no idea where we are, so how could we know where do we want to get to and how to get there? [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md)
3. **Self compassion** - Despite the desire to change, if we do it in a [confrontational](/notes/self-criticism.md) way, if we treat ourselves as something worthless to be discarded and replaced with the new, we would only cause internal conflicts and become a shattered human being. We need a delicate balance between [loving](/notes/self-compassion.md) who we are right now, while wishing to become a "better you". We don't replace who we are, we [refine](/notes/layering.md) it. We use our [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md) as a source of strength, not limitation. It is through the act of self acceptance that we can become better people.
