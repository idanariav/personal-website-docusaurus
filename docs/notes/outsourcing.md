# Outsourcing

## Notes

Outsourcing means that we delegate the production process of a certain skill to something external, could be a person or a machine. For example, if I'm not a good cook, I might decide to pay someone to do the cooking for me, or order food from restaurants. Either way I'm giving up on trying to cook it myself.

Usually we outsource when that skill is not part of our [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md), so we decide that our time and energy are better allocated elsewhere. 

Deciding what to outsource is not a simple decision, and has major consequences. When we outsource a skill, we give up on the option to improve in it [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md). Additionally, we might narrow ourselves into nothingness, because we would always find something we are relatively not good at, until there's nothing left. By outsourcing too much, we are left without [Range](/notes/breath-beats-depth.md), which might be essential for our creative pursuit and our unique contribution.
