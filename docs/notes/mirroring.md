# Mirroring

## Notes

Mirroring is a social phenomenon that is triggered by mirror neurons that fire when we observe and [imitate](/notes/imitation.md) another's emotional state. This is the biological reason for [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md), because, through the mirror neurons, we can sense the other's feelings. For example, when we see someone eat, we get hungry. Perhaps this is also the reason why [human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md), because caring and looking at how others behave is embedded within us.

There are many potential benefits for mirroring and the empathy it creates:
1. **Cooperation** - by understanding better one another, we are more likely to [cooperate](/notes/cooperation.md)
2. **Shared learning** - We learn faster as a group because we don't have to personally reinvent the wheel each time, but rather learn from other's mistakes and copy their behavior [peer support](/notes/peer-support.md).
3. **Better communication** - when we echo other's emotional state and even the words they use to describe their situation, we become better [listeners](/notes/active-listening.md), and we are more likely to communicate better with them.
4. **Shared identity** - mirroring can run deep, with enough exposure we can imitate not just their behavior, but also their values, reasons, and perspective, influencing our identity [interpersonal identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md). It is also why we tend to be very similar to our close [relationships](/notes/relationships.md), because we mirror each other back and forth until you are almost "the same person".

However, we don't mirror others equally. We tend to imitate less those who are from a different group than us [us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md)

Since mirroring is mostly an automatic process (although we can also try to spark it), it can create unpleasant consequences such as [Herd Mentality](/notes/social-environment.md). The more we are the minority opinion, the more we are likely to abandon it to fit in with others. This assimilation is not fake; we come to believe what others believe as well.
