# Momentum

## Notes

Momentum is a matter of [Consistency](/notes/consistency.md) and [Timing](/notes/contextual-synergy.md), to able to move forward not through the strength of determination but rather by a sense of [Flow](/notes/flow.md). It is a form of [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md), that by making a small initial investment, we can create a force that will propel us in the future without any additional effort [compounding](/notes/compounding.md). The key is to be [frictionless](/notes/friction.md) as possible.

It seems that the best way to have momentum, is to lower [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) and [Start Small](/notes/start-small.md). Once the action we want to do is not a huge commitment as it seemed, and even just a few minutes is enough, it lowers the psychological barriers of doing it. And once we start the ball rolling, the momentum is generated by itself through the process of [Habituation](/notes/habit-formation.md).

Momentum can unfortunately be negative. If we persist with negative behavior, the inertia itself will become a barrier for change, a type of [Path Dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md), and cause us to be stuck in a [negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md).
