## Notes

When a [streak](/notes/momentum.md) is lost or a [rule](/notes/rigid-rules.md) is broken, there's no meaning to it anymore, so we lose all motivation and all restraints. For example, let's say that you had a "no meat" diet that you kept for 100 days. Either by mistake or a moment of weakness, you consume a tiny bite of meat. Once you realize this, you feel that there is no going back, that your diet is over, so there's no difference between eating a bit of meat or a whole lot, so you go on a carnivore rampage [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md).
