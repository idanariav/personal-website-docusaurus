# Grit

## Notes

Grit is the ability to push on, to continue pursuing our goals no matter the [Difficulty](/notes/struggle.md) we face. It means to be [persistent](/notes/consistency.md), to keep going without [Quitting](/notes/when-to-quit.md). This determination usually stems from a strong source of [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md), with the help of [Self-control](/notes/self-control.md), because we know that doing the hard things is... hard, so without any motivation to do them we will never even start in the first place.

Those who have grit seems resistant to [Present Bias](/notes/present-bias.md) and [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md), they are unwavering in pursuing their cause, they are an immovable force. They are aware that good things take time, that the only way out is through, and they are willing to be [patient](/notes/patience.md) until they accomplish what they've set out to do.

Grit stems from the idea that [practice beats talent](/notes/practice-beats-talent.md), by doing consistently, we are much more likely to improve than those who have been born "gifted" yet fail to make the effort.

However, despite it's best intentions, sometimes having too much grit means we are not ;[flexible](/notes/adaptability.md). We treat every obstacle as something to overcome, while potentially ignoring the message it contains, that perhaps we have to change course, do things differently, or even quit all together.
