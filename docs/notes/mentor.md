# Mentor

## Notes

A mentor is more than just a [role model](/notes/role-models.md), it is someone who has [expertise](/notes/mastery.md) in the field that interests you, that has something of value to teach, and also that knows how to teach it. A mentor can be a professional we hire for the task, but also people we find along the way that agree to be our mentor.

The advantage of a mentor is not only the expertise, but the ability to [distill](/notes/distillment.md) and [adapt](/notes/adaptability.md) the learning progress to your specific capabilities, and to offer valuable [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md). They are able to see what we cannot, not just because they know more than us, but also because they have sufficient [distance](/notes/zoom-out.md) to see our situation clearly, without being too [attached](/notes/attachment.md).

Note that a mentor is not necessarily someone who would be your [Safe Base](/notes/safe-base.md), they are not the person to come to when you just want to talk and vent. These are people dedicate to make you a better person, they are not your friends, they are like mechanics. For that reason, you know that you can [Trust](/notes/trust.md) them, because they will not sugar coat the truth, they will not try to make you happy, they will do and say what needs to be done to make sure you stay on the right path.

However, a good mentor needs to have good [mindsight](/notes/mindsight.md), they need to know what it's like to be in your situation, in your shoes, so that they could tailor their teaching style and content to your needs. They are able to bridge over the [Curse of Knowledge](/notes/curse-of-knowledge.md).
