Similarly, shallow work filled with [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md) is also harmful for our productivity,

Today, it is more essential than ever to be able to produce quality work, because all other types of work could be easily automated or outsourced. The only way to shine is through excellence [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md)
