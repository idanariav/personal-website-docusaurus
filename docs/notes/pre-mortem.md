# Pre-Mortem

## Notes

As opposed to [post-mortem](/notes/post-mortem.md) where we analyze the results of a project after it was finished, pre-mortem is all about [predicting](/notes/prediction.md) results and potential points of error before the project beings. Since in most cases we avoid even believing in [Failure](/notes/failure.md) and act with [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md), we fail to acknowledge the reasons that might cause it.

Therefore, by [reversing](/notes/reverse-thinking.md) our thinking and act as if we have already fail, we create a [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md) and a [safe space](/notes/psychological-safety.md) for creativity and coming up with all possible challenges and [solutions](/notes/prevention.md) to them. For example, we can state as a fact "our project has failed. Why is that?", the use of [Open ended questions](/notes/open-ended-questions.md) is beneficial here, since it gets us away from [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md).

This process helps us reduce or avoid common [errors](/notes/planning-fallacy.md) while planning, and gain sufficient [distance](/notes/zoom-out.md) from the project so that we could see it's potential pitfalls.
