# Vulnerability

## Notes

Vulnerability means to open up to others, to be [transperent](/notes/transparency.md) with them, to expose who you really are, to face reality with [Humility](/notes/humility.md). By hiding our faults, our true beliefs, that usually means that we are hiding critical parts of our identity and act in a non [Authenticity](/notes/authenticity.md) way. That's why to be vulnerable is to be human.

Since people are drawn to authenticity, it is much easier to connect when we are vulnerable with them. to truly connect with someone else we have to "put ourselves out there", we have to present ourselves fully, and that requires vulnerability. Otherwise, [Relationships](/notes/relationships.md) would be a one way street, where the other shares and gives of themselves and we don't give back. We present a false [image](/notes/form-vs-essence.md) of ourselves, ironically, a flawed one since no one is perfect, so to present ourselves as without flaws is the same as lying. It is to become a [one-dimensional being](/notes/one-dimensional-being.md), hiding our [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md) with all it's beauty.

True connection requires a [Leap Into Faith](/notes/leap-into-faith.md), we have to [trust](/notes/trust.md) the other would be kind to us when we show them our worst sides, when the only guarantee is perhaps their words, which often do little to quiet down our [fears](/notes/fear.md).

It might be possible to mitigate some of the pain associated with vulnerability. By doing an [Accusation audit](/notes/accusation-audit.md), we can [frame](/notes/framing.md) how our flaws are perceived.
