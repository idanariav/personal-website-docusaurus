# Role Models

## Notes

Role models are those who set us an [example](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md), they embody the things we aspire to do, they might even [show](/notes/mentor.md) us the way. They might not even know us, but they are still important to us and very impactful on our behavior. When you lack motivation or direction for a new habit, try to find good role models, they will keep you on the right path.

Due to the power of [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md), having a good role model can often help us set good ;[Defaults](/notes/defaults.md) and escape bad ones. The change we can't make on our own, for ourselves, can often be triggered with the help of another. For kids it's even more critical, since they don't have defaults in their early years, and even the ones they have are not yet deeply entrenched, they will be more attuned to us, and we have the opportunity to set good defaults that will carry them through adulthood.

Being a good role requires:
1. **Proactiveness** - We can't just "talk the talk", we need to "walk the walk". Without following with the values we wish to implement, without taking a [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md) approach to education, we won't be a good role model
2. **Honesty** - Others are quick to notice when we do things "because we have to", and when we do things that we truly believe in. Being a good role model is a matter of [inspiring](/notes/inspiration.md) them to act the way we do, a genuine connection with our values and beliefs, and that requires [Honesty](/notes/honesty.md).
3. **Being truthful** - We have to follow our own [Advice](/notes/advice.md), even we they don't notice. We can't have a double moral standard that we act one way with others and another when we are alone. If we want to pass on a value, we have to stay true to it at all times
4. **Spark curiosity** - Even when we follow what we preach, it's not automatically transferred to someone else. They must be [curious](/notes/curiosity.md) about what we do. We might have to start a conversation or point their attention in order to make the purpose of our action more [visible](/notes/visibility.md)
