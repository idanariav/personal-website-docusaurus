# Hanlon's Razor

## Notes

Don't attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance, naivety, or lack of attention [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md) [Insight Gap](/notes/akrasia.md). We usually think that if someone does something wrong, then they meant to do it and therefore they are evil who should be punished [Just World Bias](/notes/just-world-bias.md). However, we should remember that [We can't read minds](/notes/theory-of-mind.md). We would be surprised how often that "negative action" is either the result of someone not having the same knowledge as us, perhaps slightly different beliefs, or perhaps they are just not as focused while doing it. A slightly more [optimist](/notes/optimism.md) outlook could save us from many conflicts and find [win win situations](/notes/win-win-situations.md). It's not within their [intentions](/notes/intention.md) to hurt us.
