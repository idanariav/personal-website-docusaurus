# Visibility

## Notes

Visibility is often literally the measure by which we see something. Not only that we are highly affected by [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md), but more specifically stimulus, eyesight is one of the most influential senses of all. As they say "out of sight, out of mind", we are affected by what we see. The more something is visible, the more [familiar](/notes/familiarity-bias.md) it is, and the more we believe it is true [Availability Bias](/notes/availability-bias.md).

Similarly, since we have a great tendency of [imitating](/notes/imitation.md) others, the more something is visible, the more likely we are to imitate it. We perceive visible behavior as a social sign, both in the sense of "you should do as I do", and also "here's a [glimpse](/notes/signaling.md) to who I am" [Behavioralism](/notes/behavioralism.md)

However, the fact that something is in plain sight doesn't mean it is noticeable [The Spotlight Effect](/notes/the-spotlight-effect.md), although it does make it much more likely to be noticed [streetlight effect](/notes/streetlight-effect.md).

Additionally, visibility is much more than eyesight. It is much easier for us to grasp, understand and notice things that are tangible, that are "right there in front of us", than abstract ideas in the future. We prefer [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md) over [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md).
