# Agent Vs Society Moralism

## Notes

Morality can be seen as a Free rider problem. In the best case scenario, everyone would be kind, altruistic and honest, while I will just focus on myself.

Therefore, it isn't strange to see differences between how we wish a society to behave, i.e altruistically, while deep inside we maintain our egoistic nature. Image vs core. This is also similar to the Just World Bias, where we have double standards between others and ourselves.

If this is how humanity is described, which suggests that it might not be that Humans are good as default, than perhaps the only way to align between morality on the social level back to the individual is to "erase" the personal identity, to merge their identity with that of the group, to create Herd Mentality which is a scary suggestion.
