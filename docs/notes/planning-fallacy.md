# Planning Fallacy

## Notes

planning fallacy could be either is a type of [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md) bias where we are greatly overestimate our ability to preform a task in a given deadline, or just our inability to be good [predictors](/notes/prediction.md) of the future, missing out problems that might arise along the way that would delay us. We are often too [attached](/notes/attachment.md) to our project that our desire to fulfill it makes us believe as if the project is easier than what it is, as if our desire changes something in reality.

This lowers our ability to [plan](/notes/planning.md) well, perhaps making the entire process redundant or even harmful. The biases are so powerful in this case that even the [Deadline Effect](/notes/deadline-effect.md) is not sufficient to save us. No matter how hard the deadline is, we would cross it regardless.

How to reduce planning fallacy:
1. **Margins** - Knowing that you might be too optimistic in your planning, take large [Margins](/notes/reserves.md). If you gave yourself a week, double it. If you gave yourself a budget, double it.
2. **Take a step back** - Try to [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md), see previous cases of similar planning and how that turned out, try to see the project through another's eyes. What if someone else was in charge of this project, how long would it have taken them?
3. **Consult** - Seek the help of your [peers](/notes/peer-support.md), try to find those who are unrelated to the project, that have no stakes in it's result, and get their honest perspective.
4. **Be the devils advocate** - Try to [Pre-Mortem](/notes/pre-mortem.md) your project, acting as if it has already failed. This will allow you to come up with solutions and safe-guards that will save a lot of effort later on. 

Unfortunately, even good planning is not fool proof. The more buffers we give ourselves, the more "enabling" we would become, because of the [Parkinsons Law](/notes/parkinsons-law.md), our task would stretch to match the amount of time and resources dedicated to it, leaving us exactly where we started.
