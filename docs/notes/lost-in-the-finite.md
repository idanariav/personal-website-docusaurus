# Lost in the Finite

## Notes

To be lost in the finite means that we have given up our [freedom of choice](/notes/agency.md) and put our agency and thinking capabilities in the hands of others [Herd Mentality](/notes/social-environment.md). We have become an [object](/notes/objectivity.md) for others to use freely, [uncapable](/notes/helplessness.md) of making decisions for ourselves. The reason we do this is because this frees us from the [Absurdity of existence](/notes/absurdity-of-existence.md). If we can't find our own meaning in life, we embrace others'. We forfeit our [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md), we embrace it as truth and can't even [consider](/notes/rethinking.md) other alternatives. We subconsciously deny our [Responsibility](/notes/responsibility.md) of dictating the direction of our lives.

The irony is that often these people feel as if they serve an ideal, a fake [Oneness](/notes/unity.md) with what they do, like giving your all to your profession, religion, political party, and even a hobby. What they fail to see that it turns them into [one-dimensional being](/notes/one-dimensional-being.md), their unique, diverse identity is replaced with a single characteristic. They follow a [shallow copy](/notes/shallow-copy.md) of a calling, one that harms them instead of developing them.

While it is not always easy to detect, we should be wary that we don't get lost in the finite ourselves. Whenever we feel [obsessed](/notes/addiction.md) about something, especially in a way that hurts the other roles and parts of ourselves we have in our lives, that is a sign we are lost. We need [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md).
