# Burnout

## Notes

Burnout occurs when lose our motivation and ability to [Focus](/notes/focus.md), we feel constant exhaustion, emptiness and stress. Usually when referring to burnout we mean the lost of motivation in our jobs, but this is also applicable to students, to parents, volunteers, etc.

Causes of burnout can be:
1. **Intense** - Either we or others have high [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) from us so we over extend ourselves, we try to do it all and do it [perfectly](/notes/perfectionism.md), feeling constant [Stress](/notes/stress.md)
2. **No limits** - when we just can't [say no](/notes/saying-no.md) to others, we take on more and more responsibilities without the energy or time to fulfill them or to take care of ourselves
3. **No connection** - when we feel [alienated](/notes/alienation.md) from what we do, we lack meaning and motivation, we just do it because we "have to", trying to push ourselves with our [limited willpower](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md) because we have no [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) to do so otherwise.

to avoid burnout:
1. **Lower the commitment** - first of all, we have to drop any expectations of perfection, because [Perfect is the enemy of good](/notes/perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good.md). Perfection is an unreasonable standard that is impossible to implement, and that takes away all of our energy which could be spent elsewhere. Another good way to lower the commitment is to [Start Small](/notes/start-small.md).
2. **Set boundaries** - Have clear [Boundaries](/notes/boundaries.md) with yourself and others to avoid over extending yourself, make sure you have time to ;[Rest](/notes/rest.md) during the day and throughout the week.
3. **Find meaning** - If your job seems to lack any clear meaning, you can always [craft](/notes/job-crafting.md) one. Find what is meaningful to you in what you do, the narrative that helps connect your job to your values. Another way is to make it [fun](/notes/gamification.md). Find a way to make the task more interesting as it will help you develop motivation to do it.
4. **Work smarter** - sometimes we experience burnout because it's simply too hard. Finding a [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md) that can turn hard work into manageable can reduce much of the effort.
