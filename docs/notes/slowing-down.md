# Slowing down

## Notes

Life is a matter of quality over quantity. By always pursing the next [Goal](/notes/lifes-mission.md), we are left worst off because not only we are constantly unhappy because we have an unfulfilled goal, but we are also missing out on the joy that exist currently in our life [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md). We are stuck in a state of [I'll be happy when](/notes/future-disillusionment.md), trying to rush towards a future state that will never come, because by the time we will reach it, we would have another future that we will wait for. While we wait, we will continue to suffer.

While the [Hustle Culture](/notes/hustle-culture.md) pushes us towards doing and being everything, to maximize every minute of our life, what we get is the [reverse](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md) outcome. By maximizing every minute, we [lose](/notes/crowding-out.md) it's value. We get out of [sync](/notes/life-as-flow.md) with life's rhythm, like trying to speed up a song, only to make it distorted, unclear and disharmonic.

We have to [accept](/notes/acceptance.md) that we will never reach our goal, or rather never be satisfied by it, because we would never be [done](/notes/to-be-is-to-be-incomplete.md), our life will end before we would check every task on our todo list. That productivity is a losing battle. To shift our focus on the present, to live life in a way that supports our wellbeing, we need to slow down. we need to do [less](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md), to have [Patience](/notes/patience.md), and to take [Breaks](/notes/rest.md).
