# Ownership

## Notes

Ownership is the active form of [Belonging](/notes/inclusion.md). It is when you act with [Agency](/notes/agency.md) and take [Responsibility](/notes/responsibility.md) for the place you are in or what you are doing while having the freedom to do as you please (to a certain extent). A common example is to design your workplace as you see fit, perhaps adding photos, bringing plants, moving furniture, etc. [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md)

**To have ownership on our environment is not only the result of feeling empowered, but it is also the cause of feeing empowered**. When we can shape the environment as we see fit it turns us from mere objects interacting with our environment to subjects, humans with intent and personality. [Standing up for yourself](/notes/standing-up-for-yourself.md)

To have ownership over something creates [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md), for better or for worse. We feel connected to it, as it is no longer [external](/notes/alienation.md) to us. We are not just responsible over it, it is ours, we take pride in it's success, in it's beauty, and also in it's faults [Accountability](/notes/accountability.md).

Ownership is usually referred in workplace context, which means taking ownership over a task or a project, to lead it from start to finish. This means that we can't settle for doing the bare minimum, nor should we just follow rules without thinking. Taking ownership is a [proactive](/notes/proactiveness.md) approach.

Ownership can only be given in cases without [Micro-Management](/notes/micro-management.md).
