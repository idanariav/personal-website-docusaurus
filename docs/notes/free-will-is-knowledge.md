# Free Will is Knowledge

## Notes
Free will requires both internal knowledge and external knowledge. Meaning, both knowing the [Context](/notes/context.md) of the situation, what is the environment driving us to do, what are the circumstances in which I was born? [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md) [nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md), for example what are the common beliefs and habits of the culture I was born in, what is the common view points and perspective?
Additionally, free will requires [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md), the environment doesn't work in a vacuum, it affects each person differently based on our internal emotional state. To be aware on what triggers us and how, we need to be self aware of our thoughts and emotions.

Without both internal and external knowledge, our decisions, even if feel as if were made by free will, are most likely not free at all, and are just expressions of our environment, our education, and our biases. Therefore **freedom is not just about being able to do what you want, but also about being able to do what is good for you**. For example, a tyrant that rules with an iron fist is not truly powerful because his careless actions of killing and taking what he wants will ultimately only bring him loneliness, misery, paranoia, etc... One has to know of himself and of morality to be truly free and act towards their wellbeing.
