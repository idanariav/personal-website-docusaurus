# Spaced Repetition

## Notes

Our [Human Brain](/notes/human-brain.md) is built in a way where information has to pass a certain [threshold](/notes/critical-mass.md) to be "saved" as knowledge. Usually this doesn't happen in the first time [First Batch Trash](/notes/first-batch-trash.md), so that is why **what we learn is usually what we repeat**. Similarly, what we see just once we [forget](/notes/forgetfulness.md). Therefore, in order to prevent knowledge from being deleted, we need to be constantly reminded of it.

The [Human Brain](/notes/human-brain.md) works like a computer, in which it tries to estimate what it will need in the future, and the most likely answer is what it has needed in the past [Caching](/notes/caching.md). Essentially, things that are repeated are the easiest proof that this information is important and should be saved for future cases.

This saving mechanism also explains why when something is repeated, it becomes easier to do [Habit formation](/notes/habit-formation.md), so this could also be true for moral acts or "to do the right/hard thing" [to be moral is to act moral](/notes/to-be-moral-is-to-act-moral.md)

Therefore, reviewing the knowledge in a regular basis can "trick our brain" to understand that this item is important since it is needed often, and therefore it will be kept long term.
There is no clear mechanism on what should be the gap between study sessions, most cases say that a growing interval, like 1 day, 2 days, 5 days, a week... should be fine.
