# Panpsychism

## Notes

Panpsychism is the idea that a mind, a conscious thought is one of the most basic and fundamental components of the universe, same as atoms. Many natural bodies (depending on your viewpoint, but from animals, to plants, and even inanimate objects), have some sort of a conscious experience, a desire, a mentality. Usually, panpsychism is reductive to an atom like level. Meaning that consciousness or sentience, is not an [emergent](/notes/emergence.md) property of the natural body, but rather exists within the individual. Meaning that our own cells are alive just as much as we are. 

It might be considered that [Extended Mind](/notes/extended-mind.md) is partially affected by panpsychism, since both ideas suggest that consciousness or mental capabilities are not concentrated on the mind, but rather dispersed throughout our body and beyond it.

Pan psychism goes against the idea that consciousness is a human experience alone. If it is, then everything is only as valued as it serves a purpose for us [Commodification](/notes/commodification.md). But if it is conscious in a way, that it has it's own value for existing. It is easier to see in the case of animals, but what about plants. **There is a meaning of being alive**, and while it is different experience, and perhaps humans have the most developed system of them all, but **it is more common than we realized**
