# Leap Into Faith

## Notes

Leap into faith means that some decisions in life can't be the result of a [rational process](/notes/rationalism.md), that some [truths](/notes/truth.md) are beyond our [reasoning](/notes/system-2.md) skills, that we need to act or believe before we understand. This is often the result of feeling that something "is just right", even if we can't explain it. Sometimes we just have to [Trust](/notes/trust.md) our [Instincts](/notes/heuristics.md), our body, our feelings and be [courageous](/notes/standing-up-for-yourself.md), to follow through despite [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) and doubt, even when we don't know fully [why](/notes/self-awareness.md), yet it [resonates](/notes/resonance.md) deeply within us.

We should remember that not all knowledge is intellectual, even are thoughts [go beyond](/notes/extended-mind.md) the limits of our physical brain, and some types of knowledge are expressed through [emotions](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md) and [expriences](/notes/experience-knowledge.md), all are relevant to our lives and who we are.

Living can't be on reason alone, it would often lead to [Analysis paralysis](/notes/analysis-paralysis.md). Same as [morality](/notes/morality-is-both-rational-and-emotional.md), it requires also heart and soul.
