## Notes

In order to be more successful at learning, retaining and connection information, you need to be a ‘note maker’ and not ‘taker’. Consuming information wont be useful as long as its a passive activity, in order to turn information into knowledge, one must interact and reflect on his notes. [Proactiveness](/notes/proactiveness.md)

notes can enrich your mind and inner world, if you use them wisely. this requires that you interact with your notes, reflect on them, relate them to your life, etc. at first it will be hard, but having creative and analytical thinking is like a habit that can be formed when you use this type of method or perspective on your note taking habits.

this involves usually 5 steps to each note:

1. **Connect** - does it reminds you of something? [Analogies](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md)
2. **Clarify** - what are the main points, how would you describe it in simple words? [Simplicity](/notes/simplicity.md)
3. **Relate** - how does this topic relates or affects my life?
4. **Critique** - what are the things I agree or disagree with this content? what are the possible advantages, drawbacks and limitations? [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md)
5. **Reflect** - what are my take-aways from this content? how can I use it to improve myself, my systems, my way of thinking. etc...
