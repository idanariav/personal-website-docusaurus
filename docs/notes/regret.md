# Regret

## Notes

We often fee regret about the things we didn't do, rather than on the things we have done. If not processed well, regret can turn into [Guilt](/notes/guilt.md), where we [Blame](/notes/blame.md) ourselves of our actions. Although, regret is often tied to cases where we felt a lack of self control, moments when we were [impulsive](/notes/impulsivity.md) or experienced [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md)

To make good use of regret, we have to see what we can learn about how to act better in the future, rather than fall into [Depression](/notes/depression.md) about what had not happened, or could have happened differently. It's about taking [Responsibility](/notes/responsibility.md) and focusing on [forward thinking](/notes/forward-thinking.md). A key distinction is to recognize and [accept](/notes/acceptance.md) what was in our control and what wasn't. There is no sense of regretting things outside of our control, nor about things that we can no longer change. The past is in the past and it is unchangeable, the only thing we control is how we act from this moment forward.

Regret is a power tool. It is a mix of creative skills, the ability to imagine the [Counterfactual](/notes/counterfactual.md) and asses the implications of that change on our lives. As with other "negative emotions", regret can be used as a source of motivation [Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md)
