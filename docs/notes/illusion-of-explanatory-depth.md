# Illusion of explanatory depth

## Notes

When people are asked to explain how their idea works, how it can implemented, or to define it thoroughly, they are faced with their limited knowledge and ignorance. Something about the concept of explaining it to others (or to oneself) makes it a good method for [Self Reflection](/notes/introspection.md), similar to [Feynman Technique](/notes/feynman-technique.md) or [Journaling](/notes/journaling.md), it triggers our [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md). 

For example, when people were asked to draw a pair of bicycle, or explain how a toilet works, their confidence in their knowledge dropped.

It is useful against [Dunning-kruger effect](/notes/dunning-kruger-effect.md), because it exposes our lack of knowledge. It's important to focus on "logical" how questions, not "why" questions which will just lead to entrenchment with arguments based on [Conformation Bias](/notes/conformation-bias.md). The how questions should originate from [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md), if we would be judgmental, they will stay in "fight or flight" mode instead of critical thinking mode.
