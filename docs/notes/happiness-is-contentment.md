# Happiness is Contentment

## Notes

Happiness is not a destination, it's a journey. If our happiness depends on "when I'll have x I'll be happy", we will never be happy because we either won't achieve it, or by the time we'll do we will have a different goal [Future disillusionment](/notes/future-disillusionment.md).

And even if we could achieve all those things, we are often poor judges about what makes us happy. We can even lack the sufficient [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md) to even know that we are currently happy. We also have to remember that due to [Hedonic Treadmill](/notes/hedonic-treadmill.md), happiness is not about having more, because we will fall back to the same level of happiness.

Happiness is about [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md), about [Gratitude](/notes/gratitude.md), to enjoy what we currently have, to appreciate the good in our lives. It's not about trying to fulfill our endless [desires](/notes/desire.md), nor is it trying to [do it all](/notes/hustle-culture.md).

Happiness will be easier to achieve when we would use things less for their [Instrumental](/notes/instrumental.md) value, and focus more on their [Intrinsic](/notes/intrinsic.md) value.

It is to live in [Moderation](/notes/balance-extremes.md) and [Minimalism](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md), to see that the less we need, the happier we can be. A Billionaire that focuses only on getting more money is not rich, while the working class family that enjoys spending time together is. It is about setting realistic and minimalistic [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md), to set the bar lower so that relatively we would enjoy more what we get, instead of expecting for the "best" and being disappointed when we only have "great"
