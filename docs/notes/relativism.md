# Relativism

## Notes

Are there any absolute values of morality, or it is all based on personal [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md)? When I say "killing is bad", can someone else say "killing is fine" and have no base to argue with him? What makes things right and wrong? Usually absolute morality goes with [Naturalism](/notes/naturalism.md), that there's some [objective](/notes/objectivism.md)
 standard to morality that's outside of human perception. Relativism on the other hand is a supporter of [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md), how we experience life is determined by our perception, and it includes morality.

While it sounds problematic that morality is relative, it gets tricker when we see that people tend to be more relativistic when they are more open to other perspectives and cultures. i.e [Pluralism](/notes/pluralism.md) goes hand in hand with relativism. For example, you might feel judgmental towards someone from your country that does something impolite, but what if an alien would have come and done the same? is he wrong?
