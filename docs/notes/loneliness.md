# Loneliness

## Notes

Loneliness is opposed to [Solitude](/notes/solitude.md), because loneliness makes us feel [detached](/notes/alienation.md) from others, and since [Human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md), this detachment is painful. We need others to be [happy](/notes/happiness-is-shared.md), without people around us we are like a plant without the ground, we wither and die.

Note that loneliness is not necessarily physical. One can be alone while being surrounded by people, or having a community without meeting people face to face, although it does have it's limits.

Loneliness can be created when we try to free ourselves from others. Becoming completely "free" without [depending](/notes/dependency.md) on others might sound liberating, but like the tree example, when we escape the ground we are free to go anywhere, yet our freedom is theoretical and not practical because we lack the resources, the motivation, the sense of meaning to actualize it.

Some might say that every thing we do is in order to [escape](/notes/escapism.md) our loneliness, whether we choose to [Conform](/notes/social-environment.md) to others just to belong, or whether we dedicate ourselves to helping others [lost in the finite](/notes/lost-in-the-finite.md). One requires [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md) to know whether their actions are a result of escaping loneliness or really pursuing something else.
