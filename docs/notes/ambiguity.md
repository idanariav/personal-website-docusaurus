# Ambiguity

## Notes

Ambiguity is the opposite of Clarity. To be in a state of ambiguity could either mean:
1. Not have a clear direction in terms of values or moral decisions, either because there are none that fits the situation (too few choices), or because there are many competing values Lost in the infinite
2. Not have a clear picture of the situation, lacking knowledge and context, prevent you from either making a decision or simply understanding the situation

Either way, we face great Uncertainty about our path forward, and as Sense seeking creatures, this state puts us in great ;Stress, perhaps even a existential crisis. Perhaps then it is no surprise that many ideologies offer a "simple" solution that would rid us of that ambiguity. The only thing they demand is our freedom of thought Agency. If we would surrender ourselves completely, we could find peace (supposably). These ideologies are not limited to religious beliefs, even social ideologies such as communism, capitalism, and utilitarianism could become such traps. These ideologies are nothing more than a form of Escapism. The cost of that alleged peace is too high, it means to surrender our humanity, to become objects that they can manipulate freely.

Since the world is inherently complex, we can't expect ourselves to solve this ambiguity easily and find the *one true answer*. Instead, we should accept life's messiness and the Diversity of beliefs, which is more reflective of human experience.
