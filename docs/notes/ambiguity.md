# Ambiguity

## Notes

Ambiguity is the opposite of [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md). To be in a state of ambiguity could either mean:
1. Not have a clear direction in terms of values or moral decisions, either because there are none that fits the situation (too few choices), or because there are many competing values [lost in the infinite](/notes/lost-in-the-infinite.md)
2. Not have a clear picture of the situation, lacking knowledge and [context](/notes/context.md), prevent you from either making a decision or simply understanding the situation

Either way, we face great [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) about our path forward, and as [sense seeking creatures](/notes/sense-seeking-creatures.md), this state puts us in great ;[Stress](/notes/stress.md), perhaps even a [existential crisis](/notes/absurdity-of-existence.md). Perhaps then it is no surprise that many ideologies offer a "simple" solution that would rid us of that ambiguity. The only thing they demand is our freedom of thought [Agency](/notes/agency.md). If we would [surrender](/notes/lost-in-the-finite.md) ourselves completely, we could find peace (supposably). These ideologies are not limited to religious beliefs, even social ideologies such as communism, capitalism, and utilitarianism could become such traps. These ideologies are nothing more than a form of [Escapism](/notes/escapism.md). The cost of that alleged peace is too high, it means to surrender our humanity, to become [objects](/notes/objectivity.md) that they can manipulate freely.

Since the world is inherently [complex](/notes/complexity.md), we can't expect ourselves to solve this ambiguity easily and find the *one true answer*. Instead, we should [accept](/notes/acceptance.md) life's messiness and the [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md) of beliefs, which is more reflective of human experience.
