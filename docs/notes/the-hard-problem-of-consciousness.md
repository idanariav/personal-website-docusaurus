# the hard problem of consciousness

## Notes

The hard problem of consciousness. The "easy" one is to understand what is a reflex, how do we see objects, etc.. the hard problem is what it means to be conscious, to explain and understand subjective experiences. It is unclear, even if we see all neurons firing, where is the subjective experience of seeing red, of "what's it like to be a bat".  
Linked to the qualia (knowing red and seeing red is different).  
Is consciousness something that exists in the single neuron (perhaps leads to [Panpsychism](/notes/panpsychism.md)), maybe it is something non material [dualism](/notes/dualism.md), or maybe consciousness is a lie that we tell ourselves, like free will, and we are all just robots, destined to live in a world of [Determinism](/notes/determinism.md).
