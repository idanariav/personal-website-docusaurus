# Simplicity

## Note

Simplicity is the idea that [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md). That by [trimming](/notes/distillment.md) something down to the core we can get a much more refined, [understandable](/notes/clarity.md) and implementable idea [medium independent](/notes/medium-independent.md).

Simplicity is important because often the greatest barrier for communication and action is [Friction](/notes/friction.md). If something is difficult to use or understand, than even if it's the greatest idea in the world, no one would ever use it. A genius's [brilliance](/notes/mastery.md) is not in doing things that nobody understands, it's the opposite, it's by translating smart ideas into something everyone can understand [Mental Shortcuts](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md). This is also true in it's reverse, like the [Feynman Technique](/notes/feynman-technique.md) that says that if you can't explain it to others (in a simple way) that you don't understand it well enough. For example,

Simplicity is the answer to [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md). It's not a mirror image of it, rather the mitigation for it. The more complex something is, the more we need to think about how to simplify it, like how check-lists were used to avoid errors in complicated flight scenarios.

Simple is elegant, is beautiful, but most of all it is [Flexible](/notes/adaptability.md). The easier something is, the more it's robust to changes, and can be used in various situations.
