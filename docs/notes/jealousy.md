# Jealousy

## Notes

Jealousy is when we make [Comparisons](/notes/comparisons.md), and focus on what the other have that we do not. It's a form of reverse [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md). We focus on how others are better, richer, stronger, powerful than we are, yet we fail to see the bad in their lives, or the good in ours [Gratitude](/notes/gratitude.md).

We become fixated on getting what the other have, or even worse, bringing them down to "our level", even at the price of our own happiness [Happiness is contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md). We fall pray to [Future disillusionment](/notes/future-disillusionment.md), that if only we had what the other has, then we would be happy, unaware that there's always something or someone to be jealous about. 

The only way to combat jealousy is to focus on yourself. On comparing yourself to yourself, how far you've come in these last years, to appreciate the good that you have in your life now, and remember that the grass is always greener, yet it doesn't mean it's healthier. People intentionally [signal](/notes/signaling.md) their best qualities, as if their lives are pure bliss, although the more "perfect" the signal, usually the faker it is.
