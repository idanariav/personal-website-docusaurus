# Soft power 

## Notes
There are two types of power by which those in power influence the society:
1. **Repressive power** - power that is used to force someone to do something they don't want to do, whether by force or litigaion.
2. **Normalizing power** - power that is used to get people to think it is part of their personality to behave the way hey are told to. 

The culture you are born into is not objective, naÃ¯ve or innocent. It was made by those we are currently in power, those who form the status quo, to keep the situation as is. Simply by being born into this culture, you might act in a way that reinforces and maintain this culture, even if you are not the one who benefits from it [Herd Mentality](/notes/social-environment.md).  its not necessarily those who are in positions of power like a prime minister or a judge that really hold the power within a society, but rather those who have the power to shape the mentality, identity, and preferences of the members of the society, such as the media.

One of the ways they shape society's perception about a given topic is by using [Narratives](/notes/narratives.md) and even change the very definition or context of a word to hijack our thoughts [Semantics of words](/notes/semantics-of-words.md). For example, an influencer that uses the word "slay" a lot in an attractive way can turn this word from a negative context to a positive ones, suddenly we can hear people say things like "this outfit is slay" which is meant as a compliment.
