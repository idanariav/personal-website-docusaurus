# Adaptability

## Notes

Adaptability is the ability to change over time based on both [Context](/notes/context.md) and our [Life's Mission](/notes/lifes-mission.md). This means that every perception we hold is based on it's [relevance](/notes/contextualism.md) to where and who we are now, and not on an absolute truth that is true for all eternity.

This requires a process of [introspection](/notes/introspection.md) to know whether our beliefs, behaviors and perceptions are still the best solution for the problems we face [Pragmatism](/notes/pragmatism.md), while also being [mindful](/notes/intentionality.md) because without paying attention we would not notice whether we need to change and [how](/notes/types-of-change.md) so.

Without adapting, we would likely experience great hardships and frustration. Like an animal with thick fur that now lives in a dessert, being too rigid is a recipe for disaster. We can't be separated from our environment, we are constantly [influenced](/notes/nudge.md) by it. Same with our [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md), the people around us keep on changing (whether they are aware of it or not), so how could we avoid doing the same?

Adapting is not easy, as a default we tend to resist change. It is like trying to incorporate a part that is in constant motion into something static. We wish to [stay true](/notes/authenticity.md) to who we are, but what does that mean if "who we are" continues to change? I believe it is within our nature to adapt, this what separates us from other animals. We are imbued with [processes](/notes/allostasis.md) that are meant to adapt our biology to the environment, even at the [genetic](/notes/genetic-switches.md) level. Similarly, our identity is [shaped](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md) by others as well. So all we have to do in order to adapt is [open](/notes/growth-mindset.md) ourselves for change, to accept that [life is change](/notes/life-is-change.md), so we must change as well.
