# Perfect is the enemy of good

## Notes

Sometimes [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md) stops us from acting completely. We fall into [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md), believing that something should either be done in the best possible way, or not at all. It can also be related to the [shining new thing](/notes/shining-new-thing.md) effect, which causes us to overestimate new things that promise us slightly better quality, but we don't measure the potential cost of switching to those things. The "perfect" perception of "if I could just have this exactly the way I want it" can cause us to [Procrastination](/notes/procrastination.md) and ignore the good that we already have, or could be doing.  

There's even something beautiful in imperfection [wabi sabi](/notes/wabi-sabi.md), in showing that we worked hard to get somewhere, that it wasn't easy, that we faced obstacles and yet managed to get where we are [kintsugi](/notes/kintsugi.md)
