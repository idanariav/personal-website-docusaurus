# Pivot

## Notes

To pivot means to make a small experiment to test out your assumptions. When we [Start Small](/notes/start-small.md) , we can reduce risk (aka:: [Risk Management](/notes/risk-management.md) ).
For example, instead of quitting your job to start a whole new career as a freelancer, try to do one small project as a side hustle, or before choosing a degree and committing for several years, shadow a graduate from that field for a day and see what they do.
Test the water before diving straight in.

Pivoting can also allow you to [Multitrack](/notes/multitrack.md), to work on several topics simultaniously. Sometimes, although not always, if those things are synergetic, pivoting can help you develop your [Skill synthesis](/notes/skill-synthesis.md) that would not have been possible if you maintained only one profession.
