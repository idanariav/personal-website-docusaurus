# Rejection

## Notes

Rejection is a very common phenomenon and one of our greatest [Fear](/notes/fear.md). We try to avoid it because we think it would damage our [Self Worth](/notes/self-worth.md). As with any other emotion, philosophy has several answers to it.

1. **Errors** - people could be wrong (so don't give too much credit to their rejection). This idea comes from [Schopenhauer](/notes/arthur-schopenhauer-philosopher.md). For example if you got turned down at an interview, it's not necessarily that you are incapable, but rather the person has misjudged your competence. However, thinking every time that others are always mistaken would like quickly to [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md).
2. **Lesson** - A rejection is a type of [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md). You can learn from it which skills you need sharpening.
3. **Mismatch** - a "no" doesn't mean you are incapable, just that you are a bad match to what they are seeking, meaning that it would benefit you both if you searched other alternatives. [Matching](/notes/matching.md)
4. **Move on** - according to [Stoicism](/notes/stoicism.md), feeling bad because of rejection is just a fallacy, you either did what you could have so it's out of your control, and if you didn't do everything then you only have yourself to blame, and to do better next time.
