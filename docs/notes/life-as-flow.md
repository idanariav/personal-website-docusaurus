# Life as Flow

## Notes

Many philosophers argue that one's life should be in accordance with nature. To live according to nature usually refers to how we deal with [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) and [Randomness](/notes/randomness.md). As humans we have a tendency to want to [control](/notes/will-to-power.md) our environment, to adjust it according to our needs and desires. However, these philosophers claim that against nature we would always lose. Either because the outside world is much more complex and strong than we are, or that by fighting nature we fight against ourselves, which is a sure way of loosing. [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md).

Therefore, instead of trying to master the world, we have to listen to it, [embrace](/notes/acceptance.md), be [one](/notes/unity.md)with it, and [resonate](/notes/resonance.md) with it. Usually that means releasing our [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) that we can control what happens in our lives, or that we know better than nature, and focus on [contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md) rather than pursuing lofty goals. To accept that [life is change](/notes/life-is-change.md), that who we are, what we have, what we do, all of that is [fleeting](/notes/fleetingness.md), and that it a feature, not a bug of life.

By giving those up, we supposably will have better balance in life. When we are one with nature, we are more likely to be one with ourselves [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md).
