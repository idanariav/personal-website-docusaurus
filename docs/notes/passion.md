# Passion

## Notes

Passion is when we have a deep sense of [Desire](/notes/desire.md) towards something in a way that produces [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) for it. In essence, it is the ability to desire something despite all the [Struggle](/notes/struggle.md) that might arise in the way. When we feel passionate about something, we usually wish to take [Ownership](/notes/ownership.md) over it.

This willingness to suffer pain for our goal can sometimes cause us to be blind to our actions or thoughts, to fail to notice when our passion hurts us in the long run, or when it is no longer relevant [When to Quit](/notes/when-to-quit.md). It's better if we treat it as trying uncomfortable things to discover your true calling [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md)
