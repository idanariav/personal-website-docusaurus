# Focus

## Notes

Focus stems from the [Executive Attention Network](/notes/executive-attention-network.md), and it is our ability to concentrate on a single task or main idea. To harness our mental capacity for solving [Problems](/notes/problems.md), [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md) and productivity.

There are things which can damage our ability to focus, such as attempting to [multitask](/notes/multitasking-doesnt-exist.md), because we have to quickly [switch](/notes/task-switching.md) our focus from one task to another, which is a counterproductive move because each switch overloads the [Working Memory](/notes/working-memory.md), which reduces the quality of the focus, and disrupts processes that takes long periods of focus. Another thing that damages our focus are of course [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md).

It is important to avoid trying to be "focused" all the time, as with any system, overusing or abusing will cause it to crash. There are things that can help us renew our focus, by shutting it down like taking a [Nature walk](/notes/nature-walk.md), and activating our [downtime brain](/notes/downtime-brain.md).

To make effective use of our ability to focus, we should:
1. **Task batching** - when we [Batch](/notes/task-batching.md) tasks of similar nature together, we reduce the amount of switching done, which increases uninterrupted periods of focus.
2. **Time blocking** - Similarly, setting aside [time](/notes/time-blocking.md) for specific tasks can help us clear our mind and focus only on what we are supposed to do in that time.
3. **Clearing our mind** - The more we try to think about things simultaneously, the less we are able to focus. That is why we should treat our mind as a [processor](/notes/our-mind-is-a-processor-and-not-a-warehouse.md) and not a warehouse.
