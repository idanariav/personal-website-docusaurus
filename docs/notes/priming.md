# Priming

## Notes

Priming is when we receive a stimulus from the environment which promotes a certain behavior. While it can involve [Framing](/notes/framing.md), a cue can be something more direct and pure, affecting our [System 1](/notes/system-1.md) thinking, like a small, a sight, or even the presence of someone. A classic example is a hunger for junk food when seeing snacks, being angry or scared after seeing a commercial, and feeling bad when we smell something awful. A cue is a form of [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md), when the situation triggers emotions that [propel](/notes/impulsivity.md) us for [action](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md)

It can also involve more complex forms of triggers, such as our [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md), the norms, cultures and behaviors that shape our [Perspective](/notes/subjective-reality.md). For example, we tend to feel more competitive and less cooperative at work. We behave differently in different social groups [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md), and we act differently when we feel being watched or reminded of our values (like after taking an oath or seeing the ten commandments).

A cue isn't good or bad, the behavior it generates is what's important. Even cue pushes towards certain behavior, and with time this behavior can become a [habit](/notes/habit-formation.md). With a beneficial [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md), you can create an environment with only the cues you want to have, those who promote the behavior you are seeking. Essentially, the cues we revolve ourselves with create a form of [Path Dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md), where certain behaviors are much more likely than others.
