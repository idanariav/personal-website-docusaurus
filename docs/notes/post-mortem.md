# post-mortem

## Notes

The process of post mortem means to analyze both the results of a project and the methods used to get those results, in order to improve and learn for future cases. It requires to adapt a [scientific approach](/notes/scientific-method.md) to our learning process, knowing that failure is not necessarily a bad thing, but rather it's a sign, an information towards the correct path. It's important that everyone feels [safe](/notes/psychological-safety.md) enough to open up and share their point of view of what happened and why.

Although, It's not only relevant for failed cases to help us learn what went [wrong](/notes/failure.md) and what to do better, but perhaps just as much to successful cases to understand what we did right and how can we replicate it. Note that positive results doesn't necessarily mean that we acted well, perhaps this is a result of pure [Luck](/notes/luck.md).
