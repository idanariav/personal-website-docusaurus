# Habit Formation

## Notes

Habit formation is how certain actions are converted from energy intensive actions to ones that are done automatically. First of all, it's worth noting that the reason our brain converts things into habits is to save energy. It "knows" that if we are [repeating](/notes/spaced-repetition.md) an action it must be useful or important, so why not make it easier to do? [Caching](/notes/caching.md). It turns from a [concious](/notes/working-memory.md) thought into an automatic process, moving it from [System 2](/notes/system-2.md) to [System 1](/notes/system-1.md) and constantly reinforced through [The habit loop](/notes/the-habit-loop.md).

Habits will probably not form for actions that are difficult, i.e involves much [Friction](/notes/friction.md) or require [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md) of any sort.

Similarly, since habits are all about repeatability, they are easier to form for [small](/notes/start-small.md), [fun](/notes/gamification.md) activities.

Habits usually require a [Cue](/notes/priming.md), a signal for the brain to start the automated action. If we use [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md) wisely, we can choose which cues exist in our environment so that we could enable/prevent certain habits from occurring.

Habits are a good way for creating [routines](/notes/trust-the-process.md) for a better lifestyle, instead of relying on our [limited willpower](/notes/willpower-is-limited.md)
