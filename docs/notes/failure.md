# Failure

## Notes

Failure is usually considered as the opposite of success, after all, it is by definition moments where we didn't achieve our goals. It can sometimes cause us to lose [Confidence](/notes/self-worth.md) in ourselves. However, failure doesn't have to be a bad thing, at least not in the long run.

We need to [change](/notes/reverse-thinking.md) how we think about failure. We need to see it as a natural and almost necessary component in our road to success. Viewing failure in a positive light is crucial because it lets us learn valuable lessons from it that otherwise we would have missed because we wished to distance ourselves as much as possible from it to maintain our ego [Image vs core](/notes/form-vs-essence.md). They only way to avoid failure all together is to not try at all. If we want to improve, we have to start trying [learning by doing](/notes/learning-by-doing.md).

The lessons that failure can teach us are not only crucial, they are unique, because they contain information that can't be discovered elsewhere:
1. **Learning from experience** - Failure is a result of an action, of doing. Meaning that whatever failure can teach us, it does it through [experience knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md) which changes the way we perceive, view and understand things.
2. **Tailored feedback** - Failure contains valuable [information](/notes/feedback.md) about what we did right and what went wrong. As opposed to general theories and best practices, failure is specific, personal. It lets us know why *we* failed and accordingly, what *we* can do better.

A positive view on failures can help us turn them into [stepping stones](/notes/creative-destruction.md) to success, a form of [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md), and help us gain [Anti-Fragility](/notes/anti-fragility.md), because each failure would only make us wiser and stronger. Failure is no longer an unfortunate by product of the path to success, it is the method by which we improve [First Batch Trash](/notes/first-batch-trash.md).
