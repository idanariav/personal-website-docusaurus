# Shining New Thing

## Notes

When we are easily [Distracted](/notes/procrastination.md) by new things, like a new productivity tool, a new gadget or even a new mental model. Often these things are just forms of distraction, or potentially even a [Future disillusionment](/notes/future-disillusionment.md), when we say things like "when I'll have the right tool I'll finally be able to get it done".

It is even self inflicted, when every time we see a new gadget we get [FOMO](/notes/fomo.md) if we won't use it.

Instead, we should remember the advantages of [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md), that by focusing on what we have, rather than what we supposably miss, is better for our productivity and wellbeing.

The [perfect](/notes/perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good.md) tool doesn't exist, so it's more important to [stick](/notes/consistency.md) with what we have and make the most of it, instead of abandoning it too early before we can reap it's benefits.
