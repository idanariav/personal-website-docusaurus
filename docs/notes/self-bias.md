# Self Bias

## Notes

Self bias is when we have a strong tendency to prefer ourselves to others [Me vs them](/notes/agent-vs-society-moralism.md). While naturally it is reasonable to have this preference, for example it is unjust to expect you to give up your life for a stranger, we often push it too far. For example, having a small inconvenience for a great benefit of another, such as donating from developed to developing countries, where the currency difference means that a relatively small donation for us is huge for them [Altruism](/notes/giving.md). Essentially, this means that we in some sense think that others have less [Moral worth](/notes/moral-worth.md) than we do, or that we midjudge our own [self worth](/notes/self-worth.md).

Self bias can also happen in when we try to estimate our knowledge and capabilities. We often have [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md) in our own abilities and undervalue others. Similarly, it can cause us to fall for [Conformation Bias](/notes/conformation-bias.md) because we subconsciously wish to avoid anything that can harm us.

Self bias can also lead to avoiding being [Accountability](/notes/accountability.md) for our consequences, at least when it comes to our [failures](/notes/failure.md), while also projecting blame on others [Emotional Projection](/notes/emotional-projection.md).

Unfortunately, in attempts to defend ourselves (or more accurately - our [ego](/notes/form-vs-essence.md)), we more likely just hurt ourselves [The law of reverse effect](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md). We are more susceptible of feelings of [victimhood](/notes/helplessness.md) and a [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md).
