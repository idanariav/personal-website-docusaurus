# Non Verbal Communication

## Notes

non verbal communication is all the communication we do through our bodies. This can be facial expressions, tone of voice, hand gestures, body posture, etc. These communicate much more than we think. Try and watch a foreign tv show without knowing the language, and it will still be easy to know what emotions each side expresses. This exemplifies the [Mind-body connection](/notes/mind-body-connection.md), what happens in our minds also happens in our bodies. 

Our body often sends [signals](/notes/signaling.md) even when we don't plan to. We might say we are fine yet look completly exhausted or stressed out. However, when it comes to others we might be mistaken. It's true that [We can't read minds](/notes/theory-of-mind.md), but we sometimes fail to read body language as well, seeing what we want to see instead of what's actually there [Emotional Projection](/notes/emotional-projection.md).

Body language, even more than vocal language can cause us unconsciously to [sync](/notes/resonance.md) together, we often copy a person's body language more than their beliefs or moods, all thanks to our [Mirror neurons](/notes/mirroring.md)
