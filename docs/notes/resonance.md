# Resonance

## Notes

Resonance means to be tuned to a message that is constantly broadcasted. If we clear out the [Noise](/notes/noise.md), and adjust our [attention](/notes/focus.md), we could hear it. When tuned in, we feel a sense of [harmony](/notes/life-as-flow.md) with our surroundings, with nature, with the people around us, a feeling of [Oneness](/notes/unity.md)

Being tuned makes certain thoughts/actions easier, they become more natural to us, otherwise (when not synced), everything is hard, the world is "against us". [Friction](/notes/friction.md). It requires [Humility](/notes/humility.md) and [acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md) to adjust oneself to nature, instead of trying to [fight](/notes/will-to-power.md) it.

However, tuning is not always positive, as we can also tune to negative messages, we should avoid places with negative signals, or find ways to tune them out [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md).

For example, tuning in to messages of self criticism, blame, hate or [negativity](/notes/pessimism.md) in general can cause us to become a negative person [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md). Similarly, adjusting ourselves to gratitude, kindness, and [positivity](/notes/optimism.md) can cause us to be a positive, healthy, resilient person [change starts from the inside out](/notes/change-starts-from-the-inside-out.md)
