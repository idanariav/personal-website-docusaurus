# Core Values

## Notes

We all have core values, something that we believe in strongly, despite evidence to the contrary or lack of supportive evidence [Leap Into Faith](/notes/leap-into-faith.md). These values often shape our identity, our behavior, and our goals for the future [Goal Setting](/notes/lifes-mission.md). They often bring meaning to our lives, and a sense of direction. As long as we follow our core values, we believe we live a good life [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md). These values represent our [Subjectivity](/notes/subjectivity.md), and we often have more than one value because [we contain multitude](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md).

However, we don't always live up to our ideals, sometimes we don't even try [Insight Gap](/notes/akrasia.md) even though we know we should. Sometimes [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md) get the better of us, or we don't know which core value to follow in case they clash [lost in the infinite](/notes/lost-in-the-infinite.md).
