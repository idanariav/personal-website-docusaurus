# Diversity

## Notes

Diversity in essence a very simple notion that is perhaps very difficult to implement which is that people are both different, and act differently depending on the [Context](/notes/context.md).

This means that not only that we have a difference in circumstances, i.e people have different knowledge than us, but also that people process same information differently. Whether it is due to education, genes, or environment [nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md), people grow up with different perspectives, ideas, skills, etc.

Similarly, we can also cultivate openness to diversity by trying to [listen](/notes/active-listening.md) and understand other viewpoints, and continue to always expand our knowledge and gain new skills. However, this is easier said than done. Due to the [Curse of Knowledge](/notes/curse-of-knowledge.md), it is very difficult for us to place ourselves in other's shoe, especially the more different they are from us. Without [familiarity](/notes/familiarity-bias.md), there's no [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md), and without empathy diversity would lead to an [us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md) instead of [Inclusion](/notes/inclusion.md).

Diversity is also often references as an issue of [representation](/notes/representation.md), for example to make sure that a company include members of different sexes, ethnicities and so on, either as a way to solve previous injustice, to have a representation of that community within the company or as a proxy to ensure that we have different points of views.

When it comes to values and philosophy, similar to [Simone de Beauvoir](/notes/simone-de-beauvoir-philosopher.md) Ethics of [Ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md), [Monism](/notes/binary-thinking.md) has failed humanity so far. **Thinking that a single value can hold the answer to all of our ethical questions is not only false but dangerous**. People don't act this way, people constantly weigh different values against each other and make tough decisions [Balance Extremes](/notes/balance-extremes.md), and so it is on the societal level. That's why in Berlin's opinion we should believe in pluralism, the existence of multiple values simultaneously. However, he is not a complete [relativist](/notes/relativism.md).

[Rationalism](/notes/rationalism.md) won't bring us to the "one truth", since differences in values are beyond rationality, **we can't rationalize our way past pluralism. Rationality is only a tool to bridge the divide, to find a solution on how to live together.**
