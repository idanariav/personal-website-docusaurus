# Akrasia

## Notes

When someone acts against his better judgement, i.e lack Self-control. It is also often called the Insight Gap, when we know what is true/what we need to do, but fail to do so. Knowing is not enough, there is something that holds us back even though we want do Second order thinking. This perhaps demonstrate the difference between making a decisions in a real life, vs philosophical experiments where we debate what we would have done behind the Veil of ignorance.

This suggests that our behavior is more than just the result of our logical thinking. Considering the power of Emotional hijacking, there are many cases where we can end up doing things we eventually Regret. This can be the result of Present Bias, when we "surrender" to our short term Temptations that are hurtful in the long run, and fail to provide meaningful happiness.

That suggests that at least on some level we have an intrapersonal conflict, that two or more voices within ourselves are not in agreement.

Nudge can be a cure for many of those situations.
