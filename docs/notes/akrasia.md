# Akrasia

## Notes

When someone acts against his better judgement, i.e lack [Self-control](/notes/self-control.md). It is also often called the Insight Gap, when we know what is true/what we need to do, but fail to do so. Knowing is not [enough](/notes/free-will-is-knowledge.md), there is something that holds us back even though we want do [Second order thinking](/notes/second-order-thinking.md). This perhaps demonstrate the difference between making a decisions in a real life, vs philosophical experiments where we debate what we would have done behind the [Veil of ignorance](/notes/veil-of-ignorance.md).

This suggests that our behavior is more than just the result of our logical thinking. Considering the power of [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md), there are many cases where we can end up doing things we eventually [Regret](/notes/regret.md). This can be the result of [Present Bias](/notes/present-bias.md), when we "surrender" to our short term [Temptations](/notes/procrastination.md) that are hurtful in the long run, and fail to provide meaningful happiness.

That suggests that at least on some level we have an [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), that two or more voices within ourselves are not in agreement.

[Nudge](/notes/nudge.md) can be a cure for many of those situations.
