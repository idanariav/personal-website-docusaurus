# Luck

## Notes

Luck could be perceived as similar to [Randomness](/notes/randomness.md), but luck differs in some ways. We can see four types of luck:

1. **Blind Luck**: Completely out of your control. It includes where you are born, who you are born to, base circumstances of your life, "acts of God", and more. Blind Luck covers the truly random occurrences of the universe.
2. **Luck from Motion**: You‚Äôre creating [motion](/notes/momentum.md) and collisions through hustle and energy that you are inserting into an ecosystem. The increase in collisions opens you up to more lucky events.
3. **Luck from Awareness**: The result of your awareness and depth of understanding of a specific domain. This depth of understanding within a given arena allows you to become very good at [Positioning](/notes/compounding.md) yourself for lucky breaks to benefit you [Mastery](/notes/mastery.md).
4. **Luck from Uniqueness**: Occurs when your unique set of attributes attracts specific luck to you. It actually seeks you out [Skill synthesis](/notes/skill-synthesis.md).

Aside from blind luck, all the other components show that there's meaning to [Proactiveness](/notes/proactiveness.md), that luck isn't the same for all people, and that we can increase our exposure to good luck while reducing the risk of bad luck [Anti-Fragility](/notes/anti-fragility.md). For example, developing your skills reduces the chances of being replaced by outsourcing/ai, while increases your likelihood of finding a better job. In both cases you don't control the economy, nor the employers, yet you are in a much better state if you do develop your skills than not.

As for cases of blind luck, they should teach us [Humility](/notes/humility.md). We don't control our circumstances, nor truly random events that have led to a better outcome than it "should have been". From scientific discovering to timing the market, much of our success depends at least partially on luck, and we have to acknowledge that.

Luck can also have a moral importance. For example the difference of killing and not killing someone while drunk driving. In some places, at least in the eyes of the law, you will be punished differently, although your actions and reasons have been the same.
