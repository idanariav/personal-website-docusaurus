# Attention Residue

## Notes

Attention residue means that unfinished ideas tend to linger in our minds, even if we have switched to a different task. The mental capacity is switched from the [Executive Attention Network](/notes/executive-attention-network.md) to the [Default Mode Network](/notes/downtime-brain.md). This is usually the reason why [Multitasking doesnt exist](/notes/multitasking-doesnt-exist.md), because even though we switched tasks, the previous task tends to linger in our mind, taking valuable resources and limiting our [ability](/notes/working-memory.md) to be productive and finish the task at hand.

The less spare resources we have, the more likely we are to experience [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md) and [Stress](/notes/stress.md).

Some claim that it can be used for our benefit. Deliberately leaving creative tasks unfinished, like stopping to write at the middle instead of the end of a chapter, or creating an unfinished draft will increase [Ideation](/notes/ideation.md) through our downtime brain.
