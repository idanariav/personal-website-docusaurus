# Denial

## Notes

Denial is a form of [Escapism](/notes/escapism.md) of [Truth](/notes/truth.md). There is some truth that we don't want to accept, probably because it is too harmful, so we choose a different view. Perhaps unconsciously, our strategy is to try and [manifest](/notes/manifesting.md) a different reality, one where this truth is false. We do the opposite of [accepting](/notes/acceptance.md) it.

To live in a constant state of denial is the be out of [tune](/notes/resonance.md) with the world. Lying constantly to ourselves and others is very [exhausting](/notes/burnout.md), and it is a great source of [suffering](/notes/life-is-pain.md). While admitting the truth is the best course of action in the long run, it's likely the short term costs are too high [Present Bias](/notes/present-bias.md).
