# Filtering

## Notes

If [Distillment](/notes/distillment.md) is about capturing the essence of what we consume, then filtering is about choosing what to consume in the first place.

We know that [Garbage in garbage out](/notes/garbage-in-garbage-out.md), so the more we are careful and [mindful](/notes/intentionality.md) about what we consume, the better off we will be. If we are not careful, we might be overwhelmed with [Noise](/notes/noise.md) that will lead us astray. In most cases, [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md), sticking with a few reliable sources is better than listing without discretion.

Filtering is hard because it's not always clear what should be the criteria that we filter by, and even if we think we do, the noise tries to disguise itself as worthy of keeping, like click-bait headings that triggers us to continue reading even if we didn't really plan to do so [Attention Economy](/notes/attention-economy.md). Tasks might appear as urgent or important just because they were displayed that way, although they are actually meaningless [Image vs core](/notes/form-vs-essence.md).
