# Sense Seeking Creatures

## Notes

we humans have a nature that opposes the external nature, we look for [patterns](/notes/systematical-thinking.md) even when there are none. We are also quick to assume [causality](/notes/causality.md) even though in many cases it is a false assumption [Correlation is not causation](/notes/correlation-is-not-causation.md).

We bend the external world to our beliefs [manifesting](/notes/manifesting.md), look for moral justifications in reality [Is vs Ought](/notes/is-vs-ought.md), and create such reasons if reality fails to provide the necessary evidence [Rationalization](/notes/rationalization.md).

All this goes to show that instead of matching our view based on the world and it's facts, we try to bend it to match our internal reality, or to act as if our internal reality is the correct view of reality itself [Pragmatism](/notes/pragmatism.md). We try to make sense of a world filled with [Randomness](/notes/randomness.md) and [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md), in an attempt to deny the [absurdity of existence](/notes/absurdity-of-existence.md)
