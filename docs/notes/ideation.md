# Ideation

## Notes

Ideation is the process of generating new ideas. It is usually the result of using our [downtime brain](/notes/downtime-brain.md), which opens up to wide rather than deep form of thinking, letting our mind wander, explore and [Play](/notes/gamification.md) freely. Interestingly, complete freedom is tempting yet not recommended, we actually do better when there are some [Limits](/notes/limits.md) that we have to follow.

Similarly, the level of our creativity is highly impacted by our environment. Due to the [Mind-body connection](/notes/mind-body-connection.md), being in a closed space, monotonic, and rigid/hierarchical is harmful to our creative pursuit. Having the ability to think outside the box requires us to litteraly step out of it [Extended Mind](/notes/extended-mind.md). To change our environment [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md) or shape it based on our preferences [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md)

While this process can be improved, it can't be perfected. Many of the ideas, especially the [first](/notes/first-batch-trash.md) ones will be of low quality, but it shouldn't deter us, because eventually we will find some good ideas among the [Noise](/notes/noise.md).

Therefore generating ideas requires some level of [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md), otherwise we won't have the motivation to chase new ideas or continue past the bad ones.
