# Journaling

## Notes

Journaling is a written form of [introspection](/notes/introspection.md), it is to document your thoughts, your emotions, the events of your life. By documenting and reflecting on our life, we increase [Engagement](/notes/engagement.md) with our memories, improving retention and self understanding.

By journaling we can view our thoughts as an external observer, as if our writing is a partial time capsule of who we were in that moment. Reading our words, preferably out load, is different from just thinking them. It brings [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md), and allows for [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md).

It is a form of [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md), because we by transferring our thoughts to the page, we can direct resources to processing rather than remembering their content [our mind is a processor and not a warehouse](/notes/our-mind-is-a-processor-and-not-a-warehouse.md). 

Usually it is done daily, and can be as versatile as your imagination, it can be in the form of:
1. **Questions** - like "how was your day?", "did you do your best to be physically active?"
2. **Empty dumping** - Just a blank space where you can dump your thoughts and ideas
3. **Scoring** - give a score or a yes/no to things you've done today like meditating

It can also be done on different levels across time, for example to track your emotions throughout the day, and your values in life on a yearly basis [IDEA system](/notes/idea-system.md)
