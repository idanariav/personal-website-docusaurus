# Memory Palace

## Notes

Memory Palace is a way to memorize abstract information using spatial components. The more common method is to attach an idea to a place you are familiar with, such as your house.
For example, instead of trying to memorize a todo-list such as go to the groceries, pay your bills, and do five push ups, try to imagine:
1. A bag of groceries laying at your door, than a stack of money with a lock on it at your desk, and lastly five weights at the entrance of your kitchen.
