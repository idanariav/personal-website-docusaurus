# Motivational Scheduling

## Notes

Motivational scheduling means that we determine our schedule based on our energy fluctuations, instead of trying to "force" ourselves to do something at a certain period of time [Inverse](/notes/reverse-thinking.md) [Resonance](/notes/resonance.md). We try to match what we are doing to our current mental state, instead of forcing a mental state at a specific time.

For example, if our creative energy peaks in the mornings, it makes much more sense to make time for writing in the mornings, instead of blocking time for writing at night, even if it is more convenient.

It also requires to modify our [perception of time](/notes/perception-of-time.md), from a linear one - aka all hours are equal, to a [seasonal](/notes/non-linear.md) one. For example, an hours work at 1am won't produce the same results as an hours work at 10am. They are both 60 minutes worth of inputs (a "linear perception"), but they are not equal in levels of quality.

What happens if we don't have the energy to do this at any time of day/throughout the week? Hopefully a well placed [deadline](/notes/deadline-effect.md) can help us come up with the necessary motivation. Otherwise our lack of energy will serve as an excuse for [procrastinating](/notes/procrastination.md). Motivation scheduling requires some form of [Trust](/notes/trust.md) in ourselves that we will be able to do this eventually, that the energy will come if we stop try to force it out of us. Regardless, if we don't have the energy to do something, we won't be able to do it even if we try to force ourselves to.
