# Dunning-Kruger Effect

## Notes

**the less you know, the more confident you are in your knowledge**.
1. **Ignorance** - at first we are unaware of the depth and the amount of knowledge that a given field contains - the "unknown unknowns", so we are not able to accurately evaluate how much we know, and we tend have [Over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md) in our knowledge/capabilities
2. **Cultured** - in the second stage, although our knowledge increased, we are aware of the "known unknowns", thus reducing our confidence in this topic significantly. This can also generate the [Imposter Syndrome](/notes/imposter-syndrome.md) because we allow our lack of knowledge reduce our confidence, even though we are more knowledgeable than the average person.
3. **Expert** - only on stage three, our confidence matches our [expertise](/notes/mastery.md) once our knowledge has caught up with most available/relevant knowledge in this area. Notice that even in this stage there is a confidence gap from stage 1.

Only by forcing us to [confront](/notes/illusion-of-explanatory-depth.md) with our lack of knowledge we are able to admit it.
