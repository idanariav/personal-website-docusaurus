# Fake it till You Make it

## Notes

We tend to believe that [change starts from the inside out](/notes/change-starts-from-the-inside-out.md), that we first have to decide who we are, and only then we can implement it. First, we must achieve [Mastery](/notes/mastery.md) through rigorous studies, and then we can truly claim the title.
With this much pressure, when development is only one-sided and happens [once](/notes/binary-thinking.md), from being to doing, then it is no wonder we often feel like [Imposter Syndrome](/notes/imposter-syndrome.md)

This concept says it is the other way around [inverse](/notes/inverse.md). Being is by doing, not by theorizing [proactiveness](/notes/proactiveness.md). It is not a single step of transition, but rather an almost endless [series](/notes/trust-the-process.md) of small steps [Start Small](/notes/start-small.md).

By acting the way we wish to become, we are becoming those people. By writing we become writers, by building we become builders. No matter how much theory you have learned, you will never be a musician until you have touched an instrument. [experience knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md)

To do is to learn, to grow, to become - it is the instrument to our [transcendence](/notes/transcendence.md), not a result of it.
