# Death

## Notes

Death is perhaps the master of all [Fear](/notes/fear.md), while it is the one sure constant in our lives, it is the [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) of it that drives us mad. We wish for stability, for eternal youth so we often [deny](/notes/denial.md) that [life is change](/notes/life-is-change.md), that death is unavoidable and that our lives won't be like this forever.

This is also perhaps the most debated topic in philosophy. In general, the [Stoicism](/notes/stoicism.md) tried to combat death through [Acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md) of it. Seeing is as a part of nature, a part of life [Life as Flow](/notes/life-as-flow.md). Also, because we will never encounter death, because to experience something requires consciousness, which is exactly what we will not have, makes the concept of death less scary, because we are either alive, or have already encountered it and feel nothing. Both "us" and death can't exist in the same time.

Others have treated death as a process. Those who do nothing in their lives, who waste their time and give up on [transcendence](/notes/transcendence.md) are either de-facto dead or in the process of dying.

Death is also perhaps the great motivator. It is a constant reminder of the [Fleetingness](/notes/fleetingness.md) and [Scarcity](/notes/scarcity.md) of time, so we have to put it to good use. unfortunately, it can cause us to lose hope because what's the point in doing things if everything and everyone will surely die someday [absurdity of existence](/notes/absurdity-of-existence.md)
