# Quantifiable Self

## Notes

Quantifiable self is perhaps an extreme, data driven version of [introspection](/notes/introspection.md). It has a level of [objectivity](/notes/objectivism.md) to it, which allows us to compare our behavior across time. As with other quantitative measurements, it's important to avoid the [McNamara Fallacy](/notes/mcnamara-fallacy.md), that we treat what's measurable as important and the rest as not.
