# Solve the Easier Problem

## Notes
some [Problems](/notes/problems.md) appear too hard or too complex to solve, or situations where change seems impossible. Instead of trying to do the impossible, or fight against the current, we can first try to solve the simpler situation. [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md)
ask yourself two questions:
1. what works currently? and how can I use it for my benefit?
2. what if my main challenge was gone, and only the minor ones left?

in computer science, this is called "relaxation", where impossible optimum problems are solved by reducing some of the limitations.
in practical terms, this can be deconstructing either the input or the output, for example: what if instead of doing 5 workouts a week, I will try to do just one? [5 minute rule](/notes/5-minute-rule.md) or instead of trying to do the most demanding chore at night when I'm tired, I'll try to do it in the morning when I'm fresh?
