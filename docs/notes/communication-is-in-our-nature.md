# Communication is in our nature

## Notes

People enjoy social interaction - "nobody waves, but everyone waves back". Against our expectations, talking with others, even complete strangers is a very positive experience, more than [Solitude](/notes/solitude.md). That's true even for [introvert](/notes/introvert.md). We shouldn't fear [rejection](/notes/rejection.md), it is both rare, but also not something devastating because people are not trying to be mean.
