# Fixed Mindset

## Notes

Fixed mindset is the idea that our mental or physical capabilities are fixed and are determined in birth [nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md). This is the opposite view of [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md), because according to a fixed mindset, there is no point in trying to learn something new. [Failure](/notes/failure.md) is something to avoid because it [signals](/notes/signaling.md) to others that you lack the skills needed for success, and that it is an indication that whatever we tried to do is not a good fit for us, and we should focus on what we already do best and what comes naturally for us.

To see ourselves as something fixed and unchanging is to embrace our [Objectivity](/notes/objectivity.md), to view ourselves as objects rather than people capable of change. It's to deny the [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md) of human life, our vast potential and our ability to grow and change. It is to deny our ability to [transcendence](/notes/transcendence.md) and overcome difficulties.

Fixed mindset is a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md), because every failure causes us to avoid trying again, which limits our ability to improve, which further increases the chances of failure.

Usually we experience a fixed mindset when we tie our success to our [Ego](/notes/form-vs-essence.md), which means that when we fail it indicates our own incompetence, a stain on our identity that we can't remove. We view success as [binary](/notes/binary-thinking.md), either we are talented and will always succeed, or worthless and will always fail. We [align](/notes/cognitive-alignment.md) between who we were, who we are, and who we could ever be, always have been the same, always will be the same.
