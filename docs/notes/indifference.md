# Indifference

## Notes

Indifference is when we have no preference over something. It can either be good or bad.

The bad connotation is perhaps more obvious. We feel indifferent because we are [detached](/notes/alienation.md) from the world, we are not engaged with the world, or experiencing recurring [Boredom](/notes/boredom.md), or on a grander scale, feel that everything is [devoid](/notes/nihilism.md) of meaning.

However, some level of indifference can also be a good thing, especially if it reduces some of our [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md) and lowers our [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) of life.

They say that the greatest feat of the [stoics](/notes/stoicism.md) was their ability to suspend [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) and be indifferent towards external circumstances in life. While it sounds sad, it does give you some advantages:
 1. **Authenticity** - To detach yourself from external influence in a way that will allows you to be authentic. [Authenticity](/notes/authenticity.md)
 2. **emotional resilience** - we should be indifferent to things that we cant control, that's how they won't be able to hurt us. [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md)
 3. **better performance** - when we are indifferent about the outcome, we stay away from stress and focus solely on the act, achieving [Flow](/notes/flow.md).
 4. **contentment** - by being indifferent to all the "shiny" pleasures of the world, we can focus on the simple quiet things that actually brings us happiness. [Happiness is contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md)
