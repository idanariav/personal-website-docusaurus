# Human is a Social Being

## Notes
in general, humans are social creatures with social needs. even if we could have all our physical needs met, we would not be happy if we were in complete isolation. [Maslows pyramid](/notes/maslows-pyramid.md)
Many of today's activities are a cheap, shallow substitutions of that, giving us the short-term sensation of meeting our social needs, while leaving us empty and unsatisfied in the long run.
As a general rule, we see that:
1. physical interactions triumphs virtual interaction
2. synchronous beats a-synchronous (its better to have a real-time phone conversation than messaging)
3. active leisure is better than passive leisure (we will enjoy with our friends more if we do something together rather than watch a movie together)

More than our basic needs, our own identity is often influenced by others [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md). Our values, our perception of reality, and often the goal of our desires is shaped by [others](/notes/social-environment.md). We won't be who we are without the influence of others. Although, we should be careful not to let others dictate who we are without having a say in it [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md).

Therefore we are not only a social being in an instrumental meaning, i.e for our betterment we need others, but rather in a deep essential meaning. Like being an arm of a bigger body, there is no meaning to be detached from it. To detach is to wither and die [Loneliness](/notes/loneliness.md) [Depression](/notes/depression.md).

Alternatively, we come alive when we interact with others, when we [give](/notes/giving.md), we are happier, as if others' happiness and ours is connected [Happiness is shared](/notes/happiness-is-shared.md), similarly a shared goal gives us purpose. We think through conversing and exchanging ideas with others [Extended Mind](/notes/extended-mind.md) [Communication is in our nature](/notes/communication-is-in-our-nature.md). We are [dependent](/notes/dependency.md) on one another, for better or for worse.
