# Mindsight

## Notes

Mindset is having strong awareness over mental states, both [our own](/notes/self-awareness.md) and others [We can't read minds](/notes/theory-of-mind.md).

To have mindsight requires [empathy](/notes/empathy.md) so that we could place ourselves in the other's shoes (or mind) while also having the ability to escape our [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md).

We see the people clearly, without biases or [judgment](/notes/judgment.md), we can grasp that each person has their own version of reality, and we are able to switch between these realities with ease.
