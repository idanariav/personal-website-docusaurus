# Nutrition

## Notes

Nutrition is about providing healthy food for your body, to make sure it gets what it needs, and not fall into temptations that might be tasty in the short run but damaging in the long run, such as sweets and junk food. In many cases the major obstacle is avoiding [Temptations](/notes/procrastination.md), but also requires us to replace it with something else. A good [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md) can help us make the transition into a healthier lifestyle.

A famous quote that I don't remember where it is from - **Eat food, mostly greens, not too much**.
By food it means not processed food, but rather something organic and natural, by greens it means a variety of vegetables and nuts, and not too much is self explanatory.
