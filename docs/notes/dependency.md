# Dependency

## Notes

Dependency is a form of connection, and it can either be a good or a bad thing, depending on the type of connection. For example, it is completely reasonable that *some* of our happiness is contingent on the happiness and [Relationships](/notes/relationships.md) with those around us, after all - [Happiness is shared](/notes/happiness-is-shared.md) and [human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md).

To be completely free without any dependency is not as joyful as it sounds. It's more likely that we will become [alienated](/notes/alienation.md) and [indifferent](/notes/indifference.md) towards the world because without connection to the world we are like a balloon flying towards the skies until we are either deflated or exploded. To be completely free means to be completely [alone](/notes/loneliness.md).

However, dependencies become problematic once our [self worth](/notes/self-worth.md) is entirely in the hands of another. In some sense, this is a lack of [Ownership](/notes/ownership.md) over our lives, because we can't live them without somebody else telling us what to do, or providing meaning to it. We become [helpless](/notes/helplessness.md), because we don't have the freedom of being true to ourself because we are under the control of someone else [Addiction](/notes/addiction.md). For example, a relationship where one holds all the economic power has control over their partner, in a way that might make the partner submissive and pleasing just because they don't have the option to choose otherwise [Agency](/notes/agency.md).

Dependency leads to [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md), when we are dependent on something, we get attached to it, we might even not see how it hurts us, or how we are dependent on it, because we value it too much.
