# Context

## Notes

Context is the meaning, interpretation and often the reason behind our actions, knowledge and perceptions. Context is essentially requires us to understand both the [Environmental](/notes/nudge.md) factors and the way that they affect us. Therefore a change in the context can be either a change in the actual environmental [factors](/notes/priming.md) around us, and/or the way we are affected by them.

For example, [social context](/notes/social-environment.md) can affect our behavior by changing what is considered acceptable in that situation. A professional convention is a context where we will likely act in a more restricted, polite and calm manner, while a party is a context where we will likely by more expressive, impulsive and direct. [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md)

In both cases, you can have the same people act completely differently solely due to the change in context. However, a person can act completely different in the same situation, if they decide to change their perspective. For example, if they believe that your workplace should be like a family, they will likely act in a more friend-like way.

Sometimes, we have a common conception on what should be the desired reaction to each context, which is often dictated by our culture. For example, it is perhaps considered polite to hug strangers in Europe, but rude to do so in Asia. People who go against the norms of that context are considered rude or strange. Therefore our [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) is dependent on the context, however this doesn't mean that all morality is [relative](/notes/relativism.md), rather I believe that the [same](/notes/moral-taste-buds.md) values are different in their [actualization](/notes/contextualism.md) based on context.

It stems from that that knowing the specific context and how it effects us is critical for moral behavior. Without it it is much harder to be a moral person, because the same act can be considered rude or polite [Free will is knowledge](/notes/free-will-is-knowledge.md), which forces both our perception and our behavior to be [adaptable](/notes/adaptability.md) to some extent.
