# Harmonious self

## Notes

Harmonious self is a state one reaches once it has identified that [we contain multitude](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), and have come to an [agreement](/notes/deliberation.md) with all these sides. It is to embrace, not reject different sides of yourself, even if they are negative. It is similar to [Life as Flow](/notes/life-as-flow.md), to acknowledge yourself and let your identity flow, rather than be [one-dimensional being](/notes/one-dimensional-being.md). It is the synthesis between ourselves as objects [Objectivity](/notes/objectivity.md) and limitless potential [Subjectivity](/notes/subjectivity.md), between our past and our future, our [nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md), only into a single being, that is a mixture of all of these different parts of ourselves.

Without harmony, we will have war, conflicts, [Depression](/notes/depression.md) and [Alienation](/notes/alienation.md), a state of deterioration. 

when it is achieved, often after an[existential crisis](/notes/absurdity-of-existence.md), when we have a firm resolution on who we are, then we have less [chatter](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), we embrace our fate [Amor Fati](/notes/amor-fati.md), and we feel full of life, energy, and [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md) towards [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md).

A state of harmony is the true meaning of [Optimization](/notes/optimization.md), because all the different parts of yourself work in unison, and improving one will create more harm than good. This means that instead of maximizing one part at the expanse of others, we balance them. It is alignment between your inner compass and your actions.
