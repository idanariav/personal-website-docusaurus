# Optimization

## Notes

Optimization is a combination of [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md) and [Context](/notes/context.md). It is about finding the optimal point that maximizes outputs while limiting the inputs. It's not about achieving the best possible score, but rather the best score we can get while also thinking about the [Opportunity cost](/notes/alternative-cost.md) of further investment in what we are doing [Pareto Principle](/notes/pareto-principle.md).

Optimization on the one hand requires [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md), we have to [distill](/notes/distillment.md) the essential and detect [Friction](/notes/friction.md) in the system. However, optimization often comes at the price of [fragility](/notes/anti-fragility.md). An optimized system can't account for every possible scenario, it is lean and without many [Reserves](/notes/reserves.md), and would probably suffer from [Randomness](/notes/randomness.md).
