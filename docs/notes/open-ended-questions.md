# Open Ended Questions

## Notes

Open ended questions are usually what allows to have meaningful answers, and perhaps even meaningful [Relationships](/notes/relationships.md). They open the mind, thus contrasting [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md). These are not a simple "yes or no" question but rather questions that allow space for interpretation, for [Critical Thinking](/notes/critical-thinking.md), and even [Self Reflection](/notes/introspection.md). Similarly, this also opens up a channel for [Deliberation](/notes/deliberation.md) by giving them a place to express their opinions rather than limit themselves to simplistic answers.

To ask open ended questions is the opposite of trying to [micro-manage](/notes/micro-management.md) someone. We don't treat them as objects to be manipulated, rather as capable people who can come up with solutions on their own.
