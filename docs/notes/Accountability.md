# Accountability

## Notes

Accountability means being [responsible](/notes/responsibility.md) either for your actions or things that have happened under your watch. It means to have [Ownership](/notes/ownership.md) over these actions even if you are not the one who made them. Being accountable doesn't necessarily means you are to blame for what happened, but none the less you feel responsible and would face the consequences if necessary. It is a measure of both [Honesty](/notes/honesty.md) and [Integrity](/notes/integrity.md), because we believe something wholeheartedly while embracing all possible outcomes. 

To be accountable means to be willing to admit your faults [Failure](/notes/failure.md).
Accountability could also be self directed, meaning to increase [Self discipline](/notes/self-control.md). using tools and methods to increase that likelihood of you acting in "the right way", and having consequences if you don't. For example, some [Commitment Devices](/notes/commitment-devices.md) can help us be more accountable because they can punish us for acting the wrong way. Similarly, sometimes other people can help us be more accountable for our behavior, mostly because we don't want to let them down, or because we wish to remain a member of that community [Peer Pressure](/notes/social-environment.md).

Often accountability can help us avoid cases of [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md) and [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md), because we know that we can be judged for doing these things, so we have to make sure we are on the right path, in others eyes and not just our own.
