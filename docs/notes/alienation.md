# Alienation

## Notes

Alienation is the opposite feeling of [Belonging](/notes/inclusion.md). We feel detached from our lives, from what we do, and even who we are. Alienation can quickly lead to [Indifference](/notes/indifference.md), as we lack the connection that makes us care. Alienation is usually mentioned as something that rose as part of the [Industrial Revolution](/notes/industrial-revolution.md), creating a wedge between the workers and what they produce, bringing [Depression](/notes/depression.md) into their lives because they have lost that which gives them meaning. Instead of being [immersed](/notes/flow.md) in what they are doing, they can't connect with it at all.

However, alienation is much more than our job, it's about our lives in general. While [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md) has it's drawbacks, it is still essential to our lives. Without being [connected](/notes/unity.md) to anything, without being [dependent](/notes/dependency.md) on anything, we have nothing that provides meaning and joy in our lives. We feel [lonely](/notes/loneliness.md) and [exhausted](/notes/burnout.md) constantly, wondering why even bother.
