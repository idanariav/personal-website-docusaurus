# Idealism

## Notes

According to idealism, objects and ideas in our lives have a perfect version that they imitate. For example, when we talk about justice, then there is a perfect definition of justice that we unconsciously inspired by when we pursue justice in our lives. Those ideals are often hidden from us, and it is difficult to reach them, and even if we did, we might not be able to truly grasp their nature [Platos Cave](/notes/platos-cave.md). It takes time and training to be able to search and identify ideals in the "world of ideals". It is similar to [Rationalism](/notes/rationalism.md), where our minds is the tool that will help us uncover the [Truth](/notes/truth.md), while the "real world" is only a distraction because each object is a poor imitation of the perfect source. [Empiricism](/notes/empiricism.md)
