# Atomism

## Notes

Atomism is to break something down to it's smallest individual component. This is relevant both for more scientific fields such as chemistry and biology, but also softer fields such as knowledge management.

The concept of atomism contradicts [Emergence](/notes/emergence.md), since atomism assumes that the features of the whole can be broken down into sub-components [Reductionism](/notes/reductionism.md), while emergence assumes that the features of the whole are created from the connection between the atomic units, and not the units themselves.

When it comes to ideas, we need to [distill](/notes/distillment.md) them to the single most important idea. Similar to [SOLID principle](/notes/solid-principle.md) in programming where each function should have only one clear goal. By distilling our ideas, not only that we have more [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md) of our ideas, but also it will be easier for us to link it to other notes [Coherentism](/notes/coherentism.md), turning them into [Medium independent](/notes/medium-independent.md).
