# Atomism

## Notes

Atomism is to break something down to it's smallest individual component. This is relevant both for more scientific fields such as chemistry and biology, but also softer fields such as knowledge management.

The concept of atomism contradicts Emergence, since atomism assumes that the features of the whole can be broken down into sub-components Reductionism, while emergence assumes that the features of the whole are created from the connection between the atomic units, and not the units themselves.

When it comes to ideas, we need to distill them to the single most important idea. Similar to SOLID principle in programming where each function should have only one clear goal. By distilling our ideas, not only that we have more Clarity of our ideas, but also it will be easier for us to link it to other notes Coherentism, turning them into Medium independent.
