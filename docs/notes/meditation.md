# Meditation

## Notes

Meditation is a way to strengthen the [Mind-body connection](/notes/mind-body-connection.md) through the practice of [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md).
A session of [solitude](/notes/solitude.md), where we try to quiet our mind and focus on our body, on our breath. This helps silence the [Self Criticism](/notes/self-criticism.md), and cultivate [Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md).

It is a method of [Rest](/notes/rest.md), of [Slowing down](/notes/slowing-down.md), of recharging our mental and physical energy. A way to [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md) and look at our thoughts and feelings as an external observer, like a mental detoxing, we break free from limiting perceptions, entering a state of calmness and [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md).
