# Narratives

## Notes

Narratives are our glasses from which we view the world, the makers of our [subjective reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md),. We can't perceive reality other than through a narrative, which means that we at most replace a narrative, rather than getting rid of it altogether [Objectivism](/notes/objectivism.md) .

The stronger are the stories we tell ourselves, we believe it so hard that we can't imagine it being false, even if it is. It affects how we perceive ourselves, our image, values, tendencies and capabilities, and even our identity. These are the hardest one to break. Stories are so powerful they shape the vary nature of truth [contextualism](/notes/contextualism.md).

Often, when we experience moments of crisis, of great change and doubt, we have to reexamine the narratives that control our lives. It is in these rare moments that we can break free or be lost in them forever, moments of [Identity Discovery](/notes/identity-discovery.md). A narrative is the glue that ties all of the different sides of our identity together, the past, present and future, our inner core and our environment [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md)

This power can and should be harnessed for good. If we can [replace](/notes/rewriting.md) that narrative with something positive, constructive, that allows growth, change, and self empowerment, we can improve our lives drastically. [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) [Optimism](/notes/optimism.md). Narratives have a [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md) mentality. If we tell ourselves we can, we might find the [strengh](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) to do the things needed to make that story true.

This is the true power of words, of stories [speech acts](/notes/speech-acts.md)
