# job crafting

## Notes

work is a huge part of our life, both in terms of how much time we spend every day, and for how many years. it is therefore unsurprising that we experience [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md) often.
one way to deal with burnout is to find meaning in our work. while it is easier for some occupations than others, it is more possible than we think, and it is called job crafting.
essentially, this means that we forge meaning into our work, instead of hoping that the job comes with an inherit meaning.
for example, orderlies in hospitals are experiencing less burnout if they see their role as more than cleaning, but providing a better life for those in the hospitals, while usually also incorporating more conversations and personal care to these patients.
