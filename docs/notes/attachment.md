# Attachment

## Notes

When we get too attached to an idea or a thing, it can cause us to undervalue it's downsides and overvalue it's advantages. We become ignorant to the thing as it truly is Objectivism, we lack Clarity and we often Dependency|rely) too much of our wellbeing on that thing (Contradicts:: Emotional Resilience.

There are a few ways to reduce attachment:
1. **Invest in many** - We should develop several ideas simultaneously Multitrack. We don't get too attached to any specific idea since we have alternatives.
2. **Gain distance** - try Cognitive Distancing, to ask ourselves how would we value it if we were an external viewer. Similarly, by removing our Judgment we can achieve Indifference and see the thing "as it is".
3. **Focus internally** - We should remember that Happiness is an internal state, and no one thing should be the determining factor of our happiness.
4. **Less is more** - The more we base our identity on "having" than "being", the more attached we are to the things we own or the life we have. Taking a minimalist approach can help when it comes to objects, and setting lower Expectations can help when it comes to our lifestyle and what the future holds for us
