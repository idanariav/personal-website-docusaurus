# Attachment

## Notes

When we get too attached to an idea or a thing, it can cause us to undervalue it's downsides and overvalue it's advantages. We become ignorant to the thing as it truly is [Objectivism](/notes/objectivism.md), we lack [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md) and we often [Dependency](/notes/dependency.md)|rely) too much of our wellbeing on that thing (Contradicts:: [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md).

There are a few ways to reduce attachment:
1. **Invest in many** - We should develop several ideas simultaneously [Multitrack](/notes/multitrack.md). We don't get too attached to any specific idea since we have alternatives.
2. **Gain distance** - try [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md), to ask ourselves how would we value it if we were an [external](/notes/zoom-out.md) viewer. Similarly, by removing our [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) we can achieve [Indifference](/notes/indifference.md) and see the thing "as it is".
3. **Focus internally** - We should remember that [Happiness is an internal state](/notes/happiness-is-an-internal-state.md), and no one thing should be the determining factor of our happiness.
4. **Less is more** - The more we base our identity on "having" than "being", the more attached we are to the things we own or the life we have. Taking a [minimalist](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md) approach can help when it comes to objects, and setting lower [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) can help when it comes to our lifestyle and what the future holds for us
