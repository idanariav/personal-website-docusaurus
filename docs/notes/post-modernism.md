# Post-Modernism

## Notes

Post modernism is an ethical point of view that has growth mostly in the 20th century and going strong in the 21th century. The "great narratives" that has took control of societies for the last few centuries have brought us two main problems:
1. **Totalitarianism** - those grand narrative have caused us to develop [Herd Mentality](/notes/social-environment.md) and unify under ideas that could be very harmful to the individuals and to the societies as a whole. With the use of [Soft power](/notes/soft-power.md)
2. **Lack of uniqueness** - if [Objectivism](/notes/objectivism.md) is our main source of truth, then there is only "one way" to be, one way to do things, [one way](/notes/binary-thinking.md) to think. On the contrary, allowing individuals the freedom of mind, of exploration, would bring creativity and would allow the development of a [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md) of people, ideas, and solutions.


[Truth](/notes/truth.md) is a subjective matter [contextualism](/notes/contextualism.md) [Relativism](/notes/relativism.md). Good and bad can only be defined within the community and even only at the individual level. To be a moral person means to allow others to follow their own moral code as long as it doesn't conflict with moral codes of other societies, similar to the very narrow definition of liberty by [John Stuart Mill (philosopher)](/notes/john-stuart-mill-philosopher.md). 

What do you do when there are conflicts between societies? usually the one who "wins" the argument is the most oppressed group, or the group that it's moral code is the most self-inflicting without requiring something from other groups.

In my opinion, while it does allow for individuality to thrive, and especially weak communities to make their voices heard, uncontrollably post modernism can crumble societies. Subjective morality, where being a member of a group requires sharing an identity rather than ideology means that communication, solidarity and understanding is reduced significantly. Without this, it will become "every person for itself", and humanity will be reduced backed to tribalism.
