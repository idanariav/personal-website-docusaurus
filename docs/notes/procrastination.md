# Procrastination

## Notes

Procrastination happens when we delay our actions even though "in a perfect world" we would have wanted to do them [Akrasia](/notes/akrasia.md). Usually these are also actions that we are obligated to do, for example work or school assignments, but these can also be tasks that we wish to do, like working out or creative writing.

Procrastination is often related to distractions, which steals our attention away from what we truly want to do [Attention Economy](/notes/attention-economy.md). Sometimes this is self inflicted, that something within us wants to delay the task as much as possible that these distractions become our [Escapism](/notes/escapism.md).

Procrastination is often a sign of [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), where we can really feel the two inner forces fighting each other over whether to preform the action or not. Sometimes we are feeling [Guilt](/notes/guilt.md) and shame for procrastinating.

To understand why we procrastinate, we can use DUST. It stands for the four most common reasons why we procrastinate: Difficult, Unclear, Scary, and Tedious.

- **Difficult.** You may find the task too challenging, which may be caused by a lack of confidence [Confidence](/notes/self-worth.md), a lack of skills, or both. The solution is to move the starting point a bit earlier, meaning to take a [smaller](/notes/start-small.md) step.
  â€¢ **Unclear.** Sometimes, we procrastinate because the task is not clearly [defined](/notes/ambiguity.md). We often use vague one-word items in our to-do list, leaving our brains to fill in the blanks. In order to be productive, itâ€™s important to have clearly defined actions [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md).
  â€¢ **Scary.** Our fear of [Failure](/notes/failure.md) can get in the way of our productivity. The biggest changes we want to make and the most exciting projects we want to work are also the most daunting. Our brain is designed in a way to keep us safe. Comfort is good, risk is bad. Procrastination is a way to stay in your comfort zone. A solution is to create an even bigger fear to trump the original one [Framing](/notes/framing.md).
  â€¢ **Tedious.** Some tasks are just [boring](/notes/boredom.md). Need to copy-and-paste lots of numbers into a spreadsheet? Need to clean up some data? Need to write a hundred handwritten notes for an event? Thereâ€™s no way to change the nature of the task itselfâ€”even though learning some automation tools can be useful in many casesâ€”but you can change your environment. For example, you could listen to a podcast while doing copy-and-pasting work (Missing:: [Temptation Bundling](/notes/temptation-bundling.md). Or you could create a reward for yourself when you get the task done in order to make it more exciting

While these steps will help us avoid self inflicted distractions, we must also [shape](/notes/nudge.md) our environment such that we would also receive less externally caused distractions, such as removing social media from our phones, reducing notifications, blocking certain apps during working hours, etc.

Distractions can be either fun or not, and in our control or not. There's nothing to do about distractions that are not within our control. Fun distractions we can use as prizes for making progress, for example I will watch an episode after completing x pages. Not fun distractions we should eliminate.

We distract ourselves because we look for novelty [shining new thing](/notes/shining-new-thing.md), which can also be the reason why we are tempted to multitask.

The difference between procrastination and distractions is the difference between push and pull. Procrastination is when we are pushed away from a task, and distractions pull us away from a task. Two sides of the same coin.
