# A Person is a Community

## Notes

We are never just a single entity, rather a combination of multiple identities. Our multitude can be roles we have in life: parent, teacher, friend, i.e different parts of ourselves that we embody for different people Interpersonal Identity. It can be our inspirations: spiritually, professionally, and it can also be our desires, emotional, present vs future Intertemporal Identity, almost any aspect of human life can be something that we are divided on. Diversity is built into us.

As in any community, in order to avoid these conflicts, we need to find balance by converging these entities together into a unified voice Harmonious self.
The process of unification or rather Deliberation is not easy, but so is living with conflicts. Neglecting can be harmful to our well-being. It requires Self-compassion, so that we could listen and accept even the "negative" voices with us, and Introspection in order to realize where are the sources of each of these voices, why do they exist, and what they are trying to accomplish.

In some sense, this also means that What we do is not who we are, because we can only do one thing at a time, while effectively we can have different voices competing inside of us constantly Behavioralism.
