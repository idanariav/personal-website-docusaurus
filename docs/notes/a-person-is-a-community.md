# A Person is a Community

## Notes

We are never just a single entity, rather a combination of multiple identities. Our multitude can be roles we have in life: parent, teacher, friend, i.e different parts of ourselves that we embody for different people [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md). It can be our inspirations: spiritually, professionally, and it can also be our desires, emotional, present vs future [Intertemporal Identity](/notes/intertemporal-identity.md), almost any aspect of human life can be something that we are divided on. [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md) is built into us.

As in any community, in order to avoid these conflicts, we need to find balance by converging these entities together into a unified voice [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md).
The process of unification or rather [Deliberation](/notes/deliberation.md) is not easy, but so is living with conflicts. Neglection can be harmful to our well-being. It requires [Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md), so that we could [listen](/notes/active-listening.md) and [accept](/notes/validation.md) even the "negative" voices with us, and [introspection](/notes/introspection.md) in order to realize where are the sources of each of these voices, why do they exist, and what they are trying to accomplish.

In some sense, this also means that [What we do is not who we are](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md), because we can only do one thing at a time, while effectively we can have different voices competing inside of us constantly [Behavioralism](/notes/behavioralism.md).
