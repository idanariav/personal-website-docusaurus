# Testing

## Notes

It is very hard to improve when you never try to put theory into practice [learning by doing](/notes/learning-by-doing.md). Experimentation is considered the best, if not to only way, to get good [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md) for your skills, your theories and your actions that you couldn't have gotten otherwise.
It is our main source of [Truth](/notes/truth.md), at least in an [empirical](/notes/empiricism.md) sense.

Tips for useful experimentation:
1. **Narrow your scope** - experimentation takes time and resources, so in order to not test every possible theory, it is useful to first set up an [hypothesis](/notes/hypothesis-testing.md), and do a [Pre-Mortem](/notes/pre-mortem.md) in advance to discover potential flaws that can harm your experiment
2. **Small and safe wins the race** - As mentioned, experimentation is costly, which can make it risky. In order to reduce these risks, [Start Small](/notes/start-small.md), and preferably in a [safe](/notes/simulations.md) environment. 
3. **Be open minded** - Testing should be approached with a sense of [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md), and with a [Beginner's Mind](/notes/beginners-mind.md), we don't know what the results might be, and we need to be open to accepting them regardless.
