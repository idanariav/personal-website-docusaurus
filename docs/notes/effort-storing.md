# Effort Storing

## Notes

Effort storing means that we can leverage our resources such that we will have the benefit of a one-time investment of our mental or physical capabilities in future cases.
For example, writing down a to-do list for tomorrow is sort of an effort storing. Instead of trying to think in the dizziness and pressure of the morning what do we have to do, we "transferred" our thinking capabilities from yesterday when we were focused and relaxed to today. We create [Reserves](/notes/reserves.md) of mental energy and capabilities that we can tap when we need to.

It's a way in which we try to [balance](/notes/balance-extremes.md) our flow of energy, when we are in a surplus, we can invest or "deposit" now so that later when we are in dire need of energy we could draw from it. The reason to do so, other than helping your future self, is that when we are in a surplus, the added value of one more minute, dollar or thinking is lower than when we are in pressure, when time is of the essence and we don't have the surplus we had in the past [Diminishing Returns](/notes/diminishing-returns.md).

The great thing about effort storing is that it acts as a [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md). When we "invest" a bit now, we get much more in the future [compounding](/notes/compounding.md). For example, [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md) can also be considered as effort storing. Instead of making an effort each day to maintain our habits, we have made a one-time investment to shape our environment in a way that it will be easier in the future. Similarly, automation and [Commitment Devices](/notes/commitment-devices.md) are also types of effort storing that you set up once, and reap the benefits regularly.

Every time we create a [system](/notes/systematical-thinking.md) to support or enhance our thoughts, actions and life in general in the future, at the [price](/notes/upfront-costs.md) of an investment in the present, we are using effort storing for our wellbeing.

Therefore, whenever you feel the [Scarcity](/notes/scarcity.md) of time or other resources, ask yourself whether there's a system that can help you in these cases. Something that you can build when you are at your peak, so that you could be more relaxed and focused when times are tough.
