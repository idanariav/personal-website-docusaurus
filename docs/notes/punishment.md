# Punishment

## Notes

Punishment has several potential goals:
1. deterrence - To prevent this person (or others) from doing this again
2. rehabilitation - to force a person to change their worldview/values/actions for the better
3. retribution - to make them "pay" for what they've done
4. protection - to make sure they couldn't hurt someone again

The shared principle behind all these goals is the method. Punishment is by definition harmful. It assumes a [Cognitive Alignment](/notes/cognitive-alignment.md), that a bad action results from a bad person. It treats them as [objects](/notes/objectivity.md).

Punishment usually backfires because it most likely leads to [Reactance](/notes/reactance.md), we want to harm those that have harmed us, which is a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md). Also we the punishers are harmed morally by issuing these actions, because it corrupts the soul to do evil [virtue theory](/notes/virtue-theory.md).
