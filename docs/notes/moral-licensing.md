# Moral Licensing

## Notes

Doing something good can actually cause us to do more harm in the long run, since we allow ourselves some vice due to this act [Present Bias](/notes/present-bias.md). For example, I finished a run so I deserve some chocolate, thereby negating the advantages of the run. This can also lead to cases of [Shirky Principle](/notes/shirky-principle.md), by helping others we feel entitled to take something in return.
A possible solution could be [Accountability](/notes/accountability.md), someone who won't allow you to relapse just because you did some good.
