# Mind-body Connection

## Notes

The Mind-body connection means that the way our body behaves affects our mind and vice versa. For example, when we smile we become happier, and not only we smile because we are happy. Similarly, being clean makes us less likely to think "dirty thoughts", drinking hot drinks makes us more prone to "hot emotions", etc. This goes against the idea of [Mind-Body Duality](/notes/mind-body-duality.md).

If that is the case, than it is likely that doing good can cause us to feel good and voice versa [Love what is good](/notes/love-what-is-good.md). That's why we are more likely to be kind when we are comfortable and happy, and being kind makes us happy [Happiness is to be virtuous](/notes/happiness-is-to-be-virtuous.md). The interaction between our mind and body creates a [Positive feedback loop](/notes/ripple-effect.md). This means that initiatives on one end of the spectrum can lead to a change in the other. Even when we "try something out" this could lead to drastic changes in our personality [Self fulfilling prophecy](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md). For example, trying to write one good thing a day will actually make us see more positive things around us. We can even [trick](/notes/placebo-effect.md) ourselves into changing, as our belief has an [actual](/notes/manifesting.md) effect on our bodies. Our mindset is as powerful on our body as nutrition.

It also suggests that much of what we think as our own independent thought is a result of [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md), for example, we can think of [rational](/notes/rationalization.md) reasons why we are mad, but the true answer is just that it's hot. Similarly, much of our thinking can happen [outside](/notes/extended-mind.md) of our brain.
