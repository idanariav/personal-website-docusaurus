# Acceptance

## Notes

Acceptance is the realization that we can't control everything, some might say that we have so little to no control at all over our lives [Determinism](/notes/determinism.md).

To accept that means to differentiate between what we can and can't control, which usually leaves only our [Freedom of response](/notes/agency.md) as a thing we control. It is to acknowledge our existence as something with inherent [Limits](/notes/limits.md), that some goals are unreachable, some futures are impossible, and that we have to live with the cards that we were dealt with. It is to admit that we are not pure [Subjectivity](/notes/subjectivity.md), but also part [Objectivity](/notes/objectivity.md).

To accept these limits doesn't mean to let go of [Accountability](/notes/accountability.md). We are still responsible for what we have done and often face the consequences, even if we had little influence over them. However, it also means that we can be more [compassionate](/notes/self-compassion.md) towards ourselves. That we don't have to carry the weight of the world on our shoulders, that even if we do our best we are still limited in our influence, and especially, that we don't have to [Blame](/notes/blame.md) ourselves for things outside our control. Time and energy spent on things beyond our control is simply a waste [Stress](/notes/stress.md).

We also shouldn't see our circles of control are fixed. The more we improve our skills, our mindset, our behavior, the more we will be able to influence, de facto expanding the circle of control. Meaning that our actions matter. Even if we believe in a deterministic world, we can't know for certain was is within or outside of our realm of influence, so we must try [Compatibilism](/notes/compatibilism.md) [Pragmatism](/notes/pragmatism.md).
