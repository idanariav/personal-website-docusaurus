# Integrity

## Notes

Integrity is a proactive form of [Authenticity](/notes/authenticity.md). Having integrity means that we live in accordance with our [Core Values](/notes/core-values.md), and it is usually a sign that we have (or close to having) a [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md), because a person with integrity is likely to know who they are, what their values are and what they want out of life. However, too much integrity might lead to a lack of [Flexability](/notes/adaptability.md), because we are so sure of what the right path is and how one should walk it, that we fail to see the righteousness in other views [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md), and therefore lack the ability to even change ourselves depending on the situation.
