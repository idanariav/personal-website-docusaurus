# Intertemporal Identity

## Notes
Same as a person is forever shaped by those around him [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md), so is a person not only his present self, but also his past and future self affecting him at any given moment.

A person is not a [single](/notes/one-dimensional-being.md) separated dot in time, but a connected scale. same as the past continues to affect you, your perceptions, ideologies and values even when these events has past, it is also the future that constantly affects you. your hopes, goals, dreams and [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) are also a powerful force for change. We are never the same person across time [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md). Your wish of a potential future desired self, could be a [Self fulfilling prophecy](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md) that makes real changes in the present. Even if it is not part of a conscious plan, we can be certain that we will [change](/notes/life-is-change.md) because with time our experiences, relationship and circumstances change, which are an integral part of our identity. The question is perhaps by how much, is that change [gradual](/notes/layering.md) or [fundemental](/notes/creative-destruction.md)?

We might also consider that a person is also the after-image that he leaves in the ones who knew/loved/left a mark at. The same as my future self can affect the present me, so my past self (after i died) can affect other people. Therefore, your true [Death](/notes/death.md) is only theoretic, because if you had an effect on other people, which later will effect other people, means that you have set things in motion i.e. changed the system/world in a way that will last forever, therefore you will never truly die. So which [Life's Mission](/notes/lifes-mission.md) will you choose knowing that?
