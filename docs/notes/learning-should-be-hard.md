# Learning Should Be Hard

## Notes

The process of memorizing and internalizing knowledge through learning necessarily goes through facing [Challenges](/notes/struggle.md). It is only when the [Human Brain](/notes/human-brain.md) realizes that it is incapable of acting or deciding properly in that situation without the necessary knowledge, that it determines this knowledge as "worthwhile". It doesn't necessarily means that this knowledge will be kept long-term, but at least for the near future [Caching](/notes/caching.md).

Meaning, that learning always require a certain [Grit](/notes/grit.md), since we often attempt to avoid challenges, at least as a default, so only with grit could we face the challenges and grow from them. It takes [Deliberate Practice](/notes/deliberate-practice.md) to improve, one can't learn when it's too easy. We have to step out of our comfort zone. While [Mental Shortcuts](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md) are helpful when learning a new topic, they can cause us to learn it in a shallow way, thinking that we already know what we need to. Instead, we have to embrace a [Beginner's Mind](/notes/beginners-mind.md).

We can see learning as doing exercises, comparing the brain to a muscle. Something too easy, like picking up a pencil, will never improve our fitness, only with sweat and tears our body, and our mind, can grow and adapt. [Creative Destruction](/notes/creative-destruction.md)
