# Agency

## Notes

Agency is the ability of the individual to logically connect between desires and actions, and become the inner, causal factor of those actions. Meaning, **a person with agency usually feels [responsible](/notes/responsibility.md) for their actions. They are aware of the decisions they are making, and their actions are lining up with their desires** [Second order thinking](/notes/second-order-thinking.md).

**The main case where we don't implement our agency is when there is no filter, thought or a conscious decision about the conversion between desire and action** [Impulsivity](/notes/impulsivity.md). For example, a person who sees an ad and immediately goes and buys something without thinking is not considered as a person with agency. Similarly, a person that is being shouted on and immediately shouts back is also not considered as a person with agency.

It is important to note that agency is matter of following the right [process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), not a matter of which choices you make. A good process is one that:
1. **Free of external influence** - By [Pausing](/notes/rest.md), taking a moment to [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md), and allowing ourselves to [reflect](/notes/introspection.md) on our thoughts and feelings, we can make sure that our choices are free of any [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md).
2. **Aligns with values** - Our choices should reflect our [Core Values](/notes/core-values.md)

Making decisions without following the right process can lead to a false sense of agency due to:
1. **Rationalization** - Without even meaning to, we can mistakenly justify our actions after having done them to avoid cognitive misalignment, while beforehand we might have chosen differently [Rationalization](/notes/rationalization.md)
2. **Surrendering to pressure** - Making choices without internal deliberation can cause us to feel like our choices are our own, while in reality we end up being a puppet in others' hands [Peer Pressure](/notes/social-environment.md)

Remember that in the space **between the pressure, stimulus and triggers we get from the external world, and the action we do as a response, we are always free to choose**.
