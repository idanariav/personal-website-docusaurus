# Halo effect

## Notes

we tend to believe that one good trait is an indication for other good traits. Most common is aesthetics and good looks, i.e someone who is attractive is also smart, capable, trustworthy. This is a perception that people are either or on one end of a scale [one-dimensional being](/notes/one-dimensional-being.md). However this is a common mistake of [Image vs core](/notes/form-vs-essence.md)
