# Mental Shortcuts

## Notes

Mental shortcuts are ways for us to remember, learn and understand ideas quicker.
Usually, this refers to analogies, that allows us to use what we've already learned to learn a new thing, to [transfer it](/notes/transferred-learning.md) from one field to another, and thus reduce [Friction](/notes/friction.md) while learning. [Mental Representations](/notes/mental-representations.md)

Therefore, mental shortcuts reduce the [Upfront costs](/notes/upfront-costs.md) when learning something new because we leverage existing knowledge in our favor. It weakens the idea that [learning should be hard](/notes/learning-should-be-hard.md), because if we had to relearn everything from scratch every time we would know very little because each learning session would be very taxing.

Analogies relay somewhat on a type of [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md). We expose the similarities between two supposably unrelated fields by uncovering the similar mechanisms that drives them.

Some would say that the meaning of [Mastery](/notes/mastery.md) is to have good mental shortcuts, that they are the explicit expression of our [Intuition](/notes/intuition.md). After all, to be competent in a field means that we are able to [distill](/notes/distillment.md) it's essence into an idea that could be easily understood and used in different situations.

The more we expose ourselves to a [Range](/notes/breath-beats-depth.md) of different fields, the easier it would be for us to create useful mental shortcuts.
