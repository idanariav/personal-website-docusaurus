# Limits

## Notes

Limits are in essence an embodiment of [Addition by subtraction](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md). By posing limits on ourselves, we can increase our ability to act, our psychological freedom , and our creativity.
1. **Ability to act** - The most common example are [Commitment Devices](/notes/commitment-devices.md), where you set restrictions upon yourself, only to be able to fulfill your "true desires" [Self-control](/notes/self-control.md).
2. **Psychological freedom** - this is related to [Reverse Thinking](/notes/reverse-thinking.md), when we "force" ourselves to think from a different perspective, we gain the ability to tap into new insights
3. **Creativity** - Sticking with the first thought that comes to our mind is usually far from the best option [First Batch Trash](/notes/first-batch-trash.md). Therefore, by forcing ourselves to try again [Multitrack](/notes/multitrack.md) or imposing limits on the characteristics of the potential solution, we increase the chance of finding a more [creative](/notes/ideation.md) one. For example, people who tried to come up with a good company name, managed to find better names when told that they can only use 5 letters, instead of no restrictions.

Although they have a tendency to lead to [Reactance](/notes/reactance.md), limits are often positive in our lives. Instead of pushing towards lower [Friction](/notes/friction.md), or trying to solve [relaxation](/notes/solve-the-easier-problem.md) problem, actually adding [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md) is better for us. We need [Boundaries](/notes/boundaries.md) so that we could be completely free within them [Safe Base](/notes/safe-base.md)
