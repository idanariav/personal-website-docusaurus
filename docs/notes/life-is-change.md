# Life is Change

## Notes

If there's one thing we can know in life for certain, is that change is an inseparable, integral part of life. To [live as flow](/notes/life-as-flow.md) is to understand that nothing can be fixed, not our environment, nor our identity, not the society we live in. Everything and everyone can and will change. In essence this defeats the notion of a [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md), because even if we tried we can't stay fixed.

We are ever changed by other people [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md), by experiences in life [Intertemporal Identity](/notes/intertemporal-identity.md). The only way to stop changing is to stop experiencing, which is synonymous with [Death](/notes/death.md).

Similarly, even the change itself is [non linear](/notes/non-linear.md), it can't be [predicted](/notes/prediction.md), other than the fact that it is certain. It is to embrace the fact that [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) is built-in in this life, as

We can either try to [resist](/notes/reactance.md) it or [deny](/notes/denial.md) it, both will cause us to be crushed by the great flow of life [Life is pain](/notes/life-is-pain.md). The only other viable option is to [adapt](/notes/adaptability.md) with it, to [Accept](/notes/acceptance.md) that change is inevitable, yet to direct the way we change with time, to use those experiences to become who we want to be [Post Traumatic Growth](/notes/creative-destruction.md).
