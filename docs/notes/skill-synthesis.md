# Skill synthesis

## Notes

Everyone is good at something. It is wrong to believe that you are only able to be good at [one](/notes/one-dimensional-being.md) particular topic [expertise](/notes/mastery.md). Most likely, there will always be someone better than you in any one topic, but if you [diversify](/notes/breath-beats-depth.md) your knowledge, you will be able to find the **combination** of skills that gives you your [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md) and makes you the best at something.

Finding and cultivating your unique skills is not easy. It takes both [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md) to know what you are good at without being [over confident](/notes/over-confidence.md), while also [experimenting](/notes/testing.md) a lot until you find your unique combination.
