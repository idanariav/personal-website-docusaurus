# kintsugi

## Notes

Kintsugi is the Japanese art of rebuilding broken objects. When a bowl for example is broken, they glue it together using a golden paste. The final product could be even more beautiful than the original. This reminds me of [Anti-Fragility](/notes/anti-fragility.md). Even when we brake, we should rise from those cases, learn from those challenges, to create something new. 

**That "something new" isn't forgetful of the past, we don't hide our mistakes or failures. We ware them proudly on our sleeves, and we will become stronger and more beautiful because of it** [Layering](/notes/layering.md). To hide our cracks is to forget who we are, to create a conflict between our image and ourselves [Image vs core](/notes/form-vs-essence.md). 

We see that there is beauty in the broken [To be is to be incomplete](/notes/to-be-is-to-be-incomplete.md), signs of lessons learned, of journeys taken. That life is a path, both creation and destruction, nothing is fixed in time [Intertemporal Identity](/notes/intertemporal-identity.md).
