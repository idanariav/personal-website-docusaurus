# Validation

## Notes

Validation is a matter of accepting the feelings, thoughts and identity of others, instead of trying to convert their viewpoint or [dismiss](/notes/gaslighting.md) their feelings or personality. While it doesn't mean that we have to agree with them, we do have to understand them, and accept that they feel this way and they are entitled to their feelings. Most often validation is the first step to [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md).

To validate someone, we first have to [listen](/notes/active-listening.md) to them, because empathetic as we might be, without understanding them we wouldn't be able to connect. [Mirroring](/notes/mirroring.md) is a good technique to show someone that you are listening and understanding them.

Second, we need to remove all form of [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md). To judge someone, even if we are not explicitly saying it, means that we are not treating them as a supportive friend, rather as a critic. It is often not something that we can fake, we truly have to be free of judgment, because most often it can be seen through our [non verbal communication](/notes/non-verbal-communication.md).

Validating also leads to [Inclusion](/notes/inclusion.md). We need to accept, to see others as they are in order to let them in, to make them a part of our family, our community, our minds. To help them help us.

Remember that sometimes, the person who needs validation the most is yourself [Self affirmation](/notes/self-affirmation.md). In order to prevent [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), and create a [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md), we first have to accept who we are.
