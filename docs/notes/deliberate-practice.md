# Deliberate Practice

## Notes

Deliberate Practice is the best way to learn, to gain new skills and to [grow](/notes/growth-mindset.md).

Deliberate practice as the name suggests isn't easy, because [learning should be hard](/notes/learning-should-be-hard.md). It is through challenges that we are able to grow [Obstacles as stepping stones](/notes/creative-destruction.md), raw talent [isn't enough](/notes/practice-beats-talent.md). It won't be fun, it will be hard, and it will require [Grit](/notes/grit.md), but this is the only way to achieve [Mastery](/notes/mastery.md). Deciding to do a delibarate practice is not something you do on a whim. Make sure you have sufficient [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) for it otherwise you will experience [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md) or you will quit.

common components of deliberate practice:
1. **Feedback** - without knowing what you did right and wrong it's harder to improve. [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md)
2. **Challenge** - a good practice is one which tries to stretch your limits. not too hard, but not too easy [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md)
3. **Goal** - you must have a goal you're trying to reach, something concrete and easy to measure [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md).
4. **Technique** - improving is usually not by trying harder, but by trying smarter. Find a method that works for you. [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md)
5. **Mentor** - it is rare that one can do a deliberate practice alone. When we practice our talent, we need to have our complete attention devoted to it, to experience [flow](/notes/flow.md). That's why we need an external observer (and an expert's) that can point us towards the right direction [Mentor](/notes/mentor.md) .
