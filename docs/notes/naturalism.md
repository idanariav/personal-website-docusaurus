# Naturalism

## Notes

There is nothing mystical or supernatural in the world. All that we know, see and feel are natural phenomenon. Even morality is a matter of chemical reactions and natural properties, there is no soul or higher power that determines what's right and wrong. It's either "in our blood" or non at all. Naturalism goes hand in hand with [Empiricism](/notes/empiricism.md) and rejects [Idealism](/notes/idealism.md)
