# Weak Ties

## Notes

Weak ties are a type of social relations in which we are not considered close to that person. This could be a colleague, a friend of a friend, a person you went to school/university/used to work with that you are not in constant relations any more.

The advantages of weak ties are that since you are not close, that usually means you are part of different social circles, which means that you have a small overlap of connections, and therefore an access to a whole new set of potential connections. This could be useful for example when looking for a new job.
