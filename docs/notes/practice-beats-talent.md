# Practice Beats Talent

## Notes

Initial [talent](/notes/competence.md) can only get you so far, and in most cases it is not even real. The best and only way to truly achieve [Mastery](/notes/mastery.md) is to practice, and practice hard [Deliberate Practice](/notes/deliberate-practice.md). Being better is not a matter of what you were given at birth, it is not decided in a single moment, it is a matter of [process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), of [Consistency](/notes/consistency.md) and [Grit](/notes/grit.md). Those who work hard constantly are those who will go further than the rest.

Furthermore, the idea of innate talent can be harmful in several ways:
1. **Those with innate talent become complicit** - ignoring practice and therefore lose their edge [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md) [over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md)
2. **Too much praise from the environment** - The environment, like teachers and parents tend to focus on those who show promise first, which might be due to completely random causes, and create a [Self fulfilling prophecy](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md) of who might succeed in this area and who doesn't. (Believing that you can succeed will increase your chances of doing so, and vice versa).
3. **It is hard to predict who will succeed** - we currently have not yet figured out how to accuracy [predict](/notes/prediction.md) those who would become great, so the promise of innate talent is more like a mirage.
