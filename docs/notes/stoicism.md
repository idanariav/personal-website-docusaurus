# Stoicism

## Notes

Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy that has much to teach us about overcoming [Hardships](/notes/struggle.md). In times of great instability, war and political struggles, one was constantly bombarded with threats and uncertainty. From these tough times, a philosophy emerged aimed to grant us [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md). It is a form of [virtue theory](/notes/virtue-theory.md), by cultivating the right virtues and the right mindset, we can go through life with less suffering.

The main tenants of stoicism:
1. **Cognitive dissonance** - Perceiving something as "good" or "bad" stems from our [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md), not from inherit part of the action. Much of our suffering therefore depends on how we see the world. By practicing [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md), we can see things as they are, without the added suffering caused by our own judgment.
2. **Holistically** - People are more than their actions, and so are you. Consider the [circumstances](/notes/context.md) in which people operate. Remember that others (or you) might be wrong, acting on good intentions or succumbed to emotions or weaknesses, so don't be quick to assign [malice](/notes/hanlons-razor.md) to their behavior. Have [Humility](/notes/humility.md) in the way you think of others, you never know the full picture, and best to assume that [People are inherently good](/notes/humans-are-good-as-default.md)
3. **Guidance** - Seek the council of those who can help you fulfill your potential. what would your [mentors](/notes/mentor.md) say/do in this situation. Have mentors real or imaginary in your life, act with thoughtfulness and intention.
4. **stress inculcation** - prepare for the worst, and think of solutions. Treat challenges as a way to [strengthen](/notes/creative-destruction.md) your mental durability. Try to look at things in perspective by asking yourself "so what?". Usually the actual outcome would be far from the "worse case scenario". This would remove much of your [Stress](/notes/stress.md).
5. **self awareness** - [Reflect](/notes/introspection.md) daily to check if actions match your virtues, whether you are on the right path, practicing who you wish to become.
6. **Practice agency** - Emotions and urges will naturally arise, but you have the ability and freedom to decide how to respond. (Related:: [Agency](/notes/agency.md). You don't always control your circumstances, but you can always, always, choose how to react, so make sure you do so according to your values.
7. **Connect** - To be wise is to see that we are all connected, strive to improve the life of people you meet, since they are your family, even those who have done you wrong [Altruism](/notes/giving.md).
8. **Be a student** - every situation, especially the bad ones, are opportunities for growth, either by learning something new, or a chance to practice your virtues. [Lifelong Learning](/notes/lifelong-learning.md). Never think that you are "finished", that you are above mistakes or that your skills are perfect. Reality will constantly show us the error of our ways, it is up to us to listen to it and learn from it.
