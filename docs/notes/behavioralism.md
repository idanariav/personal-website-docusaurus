# Behavioralism

## Notes

Behavioralism is a theory which suggests that the best way of measuring someone's preferences is to look at their behavior. It assumes that [Cognitive Alignment](/notes/cognitive-alignment.md) is common in most cases, meaning that our actions reflect our true preferences.

However, it fails to account for cases of [Insight Gap](/notes/akrasia.md), where we know what we should do yet we fail to do so, and ignores cases of [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md). It also undermines the reasons for [Nudge](/notes/nudge.md), because if people would have wanted a different outcome, they would have said so.

The advantages are that it escapes the [Theory of Mind](/notes/theory-of-mind.md), no need to get into someone's head in order to understand what motivates them, we can look at their behavior and reverse engineer it.
