# Forgetfulness

## Notes

Forgetfulness is a double edged sword of human behavior. On the one hand, it seems mostly negative. When we forget things, we can more easily fall pray to [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md) while failing to return to the important thing. We might experience cases of [Insight Gap](/notes/akrasia.md), where we know what we should do, but fail to do it because we keep on forgetting.

It can also hurt our learning, our relationships, and basically every aspect of our lives. One might even ask, are we truly the same person (or the person we claim to be), if we constantly forget who we are [Intertemporal Identity](/notes/intertemporal-identity.md).

However, forgetting also has a positive side. Without forgetting, we could have never changed [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md), because we couldn't have been freed from the past, and would have continued to act in the same way. We also would have drowned in the [Noise](/notes/noise.md), unable to separate the important from the irrelevant. [our mind is a processor and not a warehouse](/notes/our-mind-is-a-processor-and-not-a-warehouse.md). Forgetting therefore is essential for learning [Layering](/notes/layering.md), for growing, and changing. [Creative Destruction](/notes/creative-destruction.md)
