# Reductionism

## Notes

According to reductionism, many of life's properties, can be understood, explained, or better viewed as when we [distill](/notes/distillment.md) it to it's core. For example, questions about meaning and happiness seems too big to tackle, but perhaps a good enough explanation for our reasons for action could be explained through the lens of [Utility](/notes/utility.md), to reduce the question of happiness to a simple pain/pleasure framework.

Rather than believe that [truth](/notes/truth.md) is an [emergent](/notes/emergence.md) property, it means to believe that it is in the details. That to [simplify](/notes/simplicity.md) problems into small manageable units is not only better it's also more correct [Solve the easier problem](/notes/solve-the-easier-problem.md)
