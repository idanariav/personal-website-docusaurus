# Perfectionism

## Notes

Perfectionism is the pursuit of [excellence](/notes/mastery.md), of doing every action in the most optimal form. However, it is known that perfectionism can be actually harmful to our progress rather than contributing, because:
1. **Scarcity** - [Scarcity](/notes/scarcity.md) of time and resource is always true no matter what we do. Any minute we spend on "perfecting" one thing is not invested in doing something else. And due to the [Pareto Principle](/notes/pareto-principle.md) and the effect of [Diminishing Returns](/notes/diminishing-returns.md) it is more likely we are spending our time unwisely. We fail to consider the costs of our perfectionism in terms of [Alternative cost](/notes/alternative-cost.md).
2. **Burnout** - as they say, "the best is the enemy of good". Wishing to do everything perfect rather than "good enough" might cause us to [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md) or [Procrastination](/notes/procrastination.md) when we feel how hard it is to do something perfect, or we might think that "if we can't do it perfectly, there is no point in trying"
3. **Progress** - doing something perfectly on the first try is almost impossible because [First Batch Trash](/notes/first-batch-trash.md). Moreover, it takes practice to become better at something. Repetition would not only make us better at it, but will also increase the chance of creating a better solution than if we would have focused just on a single "perfect" solution [Multitrack](/notes/multitrack.md) [practice beats perfection](/notes/practice-beats-perfection.md)
