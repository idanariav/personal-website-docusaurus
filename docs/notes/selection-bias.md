# Selection Bias

## Notes

Selection Bias is when we unintentionally create a situation of [Garbage in garbage out](/notes/garbage-in-garbage-out.md) by having a biased data to use in our model or in our thinking process. For example, deciding to run a "do you support gun legislation" survey at a NRA conference will lead to biased results and won't truly represent the actual population [Population and sample estimates](/notes/population-and-sample-estimates.md). Some cases can be less obvious, like doing surveys over the phone, while not asking ourselves which population is less likely to have a phone (Amish, elderly, kids...).
