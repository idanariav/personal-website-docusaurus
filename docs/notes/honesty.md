# Honesty

## Notes

Honesty is about being truthful, if it is about yourself, then you are [authentic](/notes/authenticity.md), but this can also be about others and your opinions on the situation, regardless of your beliefs and preferences.

There can be such thing as too much honesty, because we humans tend to be able to deal with certain amounts of truth depending on the situation. So while some truths can be too hard to hear, there can also be cases where some white lies, or partial truths are appropriate [Moderation](/notes/balance-extremes.md). But in general, honesty is about being truthful and candor.

Honesty is best combined with [Humility](/notes/humility.md), because it is important that we, and those we speak with, remember that what we say is a reflection of our [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md), and that we don't claim that we posses the absolute truth.

Honesty often breeds [Trust](/notes/trust.md), because others know that we can be [counted](/notes/accountability.md) on, that our thought processes, values and opinions are open for everyone to see, which at the least removes [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) in their eyes.

Honesty is also a sign of [Integrity](/notes/integrity.md), because we have the courage to align what we say with what we believe in, with what we do.

At an organizational level, it brings [Transparency](/notes/transparency.md), because if everyone is honest, than no decision is made in the dark, and usually it is accompanied by an explanation.

Honesty is the first step to [Acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md), because it encourages us to be true to ourselves, to shed any illusions we might have, and to acknowledge the truths of the world, which means both understanding ourselves, and our place in the world.
