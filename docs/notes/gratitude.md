# Gratitude

## Notes

Practicing gratitude has a huge effect on our lives be it means to change our [Perspective](/notes/subjective-reality.md) to a positive one. When we "force" ourselves to find something to be grateful for, we shift our focus from negative to positive events, acknowledging the good we have in our lives, noticing which things truly bring us happiness [introspection](/notes/introspection.md), and how even in the most difficult cases we have something that we can be grateful for, priming us for [Optimism](/notes/optimism.md).

It shows us that whether life is "good" or "bad" is a matter of personal [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md). By deciding to shift our mentality, we can shape the subjective experience of our lives, such that they would feel better, even if objectively nothing has changed.

For example, a person who feels exhausted from work but decides to focus on the good things in his life, perhaps his family, his partner, friends or health, would find more joy and energy to go on with his life.

Gratitude shapes our [expectations](/notes/expectations.md) by shifting our attitude from taking things for granted to be grateful that they exist, and how it's not obvious that they do. We acknowledge the rarity and beauty of [fleeting](/notes/fleetingness.md) moments, of how it's not obvious that we have so many good things in life that we fail to appreciate.

To practice gratitude also means to be more [present](/notes/intentionality.md) in the now, otherwise we would be too busy with our thoughts to notice what we're grateful for [stress](/notes/stress.md).

As simple as being grateful for 1-3 things a day can be enough to change our perspective entirely [Start Small](/notes/start-small.md).

It is also a catalyst for [Kindness](/notes/giving.md), when we acknowledge the good we receive from others, we are more likely to give back.

We are what we focus on, so focusing on positive things would bring more joy to our lives than focusing on the negative.
