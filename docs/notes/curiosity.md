# Curiosity

## Notes

Curiosity is when we feel a strong desire to fill the gaps in our knowledge. This doesn't come from the fear of not knowing the answer, but rather the joy in discovering it. We are aware of our lack of knowledge, but it doesn't disturb us, on the contrary, it is fun and [motivating](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md). It is a force of [positivity](/notes/optimism.md) and [proactivity](/notes/proactiveness.md) that puts us in a [Beginner's Mind](/notes/beginners-mind.md), free of internal or external [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) or adherence to certain [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md).

To be curious, we first have to remove any aspect of [External Motivation](/notes/external-motivation.md). Once we explore a topic for an external benefit such as catering to our ego, avoiding embarrassment, to answer someone else's question, it [crowds out](/notes/crowding-out.md) any feelings of curiosity. We have to want to discover it for the joy of discovery, for the importance of the answer [itself](/notes/intrinsic.md), not the [Instrumental](/notes/instrumental.md) that require it.
