# Emotional Projection

## Notes

Projection is when we see our emotions in others, but not in ourselves, we lack [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md). When we are angry, we think others are angry. It causes confusion because our words don't match our emotional state. We take our anger out onto the world, thinking we are clear from [Blame](/notes/blame.md). Instead of [syncing](/notes/mirroring.md) with the other's emotional state , we try to force our own onto others.

Projection blocks our ability to [empathize](/notes/empathy.md) or [listen](/notes/active-listening.md) to the other side. We are so focused on [ourselves](/notes/self-bias.md) that we can't see the other side for who they are and how they feel. We treat them as something to vent on, might as well be a rubber duck, than a person. This is worth remembering when you experience [Reactance](/notes/reactance.md) from others, it's not necessarily an indication of you so much as they are trying to throw their issues onto you.

Projection is often triggered by [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md), when we are overwhelmed by our emotions that we instinctively feel that the only way to gid rid of them is to vent. We do this subconsciously. Same as hijacking, only by taking a [Pause](/notes/rest.md) we can look inwards and gain clearer perspective.

Also, venting is proven to be more harmful than good. When we express our anger, it doesn't make us less angry, the opposite, it makes us more. Projection can often lead to a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md) of strengthening the emotions we wish to overcome. Only with self awareness and [validating](/notes/validation.md) our emotions instead of suppressing them we could avoid projecting them onto others.
