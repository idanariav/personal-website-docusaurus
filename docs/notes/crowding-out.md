# Crowding Out

## Notes

Crowding out is when the increase of one activity causes a decrease in another, similar to [homeostasis](/notes/balance-extremes.md) process. In economics, this is often referred to cases where the more the government invests in something, the less the private sector will invest. Similarly, if a boss tries to motivate his workers with [monetary](/notes/external-motivation.md) incentives, it might replace [intrinsic motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md).

We should be wary of cases of crowding out because it means we work harder but we achieve the same, or less. [The law of reverse effect](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md).

How to identify such cases?
1. **Diminishing/negative returns** - we have reached a point where additional investment has little to no (or even negative) [effect](/notes/diminishing-returns.md)
2. **It becomes harder** - we sense more [friction](/notes/friction.md) in what we're trying to do when previously is was easy
3. **Shallow replacement** - we have the same (or more) quantity, but the quality has diminished [Goodhart‚Äôs Law](/notes/goodhart‚Äôs-law.md)

What to do instead:
1. **Identity incentives** - before interfering, examine the current [incentives](/notes/incentives.md) and preferences and see which outcomes they generate.
2. **Go with the flow** - support existing processes to increase the effectiveness, instead of trying to artificially replace it [ripple effect](/notes/ripple-effect.md)
3. **We are not econs** - remember that most often people care about more than just monetary [gain](/notes/econs.md). Consider first social, moral and aspirational preferences first.
4. **Do nothing** - sometimes the best we can do is nothing, we can't increase something even if we really want to. We need to have more [acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md)
