# Intelligence is not morality

## Notes

Smart people are not necessarily good people, and not just because they fail to follow their own advice [Akrasia](/notes/akrasia.md). Intelligence is focused only on our ability to implement our goals, while ethics is focused on what those goals are. Therefore increasing our knowledge doesn't mean we are becoming better people. 

The best we can hope for when sticking with intelligence alone is a misguided [Utilitarianism](/notes/utilitarianism.md), where the person tries to maximize something, like pleasure, ignoring all other aspects of morality. [Morality is both rational and emotional](/notes/morality-is-both-rational-and-emotional.md)
