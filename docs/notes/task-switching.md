# Task Switching 

## Notes

Task Switching is the idea that by switching our [Focus](/notes/focus.md) from task to task we pay a price in terms of our productivity. Setting up a task, i.e to "get into the zone" takes time and effort, so by switching constantly between tasks we spend more and more of our mental energy and time just setting up the next task instead of actually doing something productive. That's why [Multitasking doesnt exist](/notes/multitasking-doesnt-exist.md).

This cost occurs also when our attention fades due to [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md), which makes the cost of distractions not only the minutes we spend looking at those, but also all the time it takes to "reload" the task
