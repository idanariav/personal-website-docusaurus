# Free Rider

## Notes

Free rider is a person that uses the [altrustic](/notes/giving.md) nature of others for their own benefit. It is those who contribute nothing to the common good, yet take the most they can, they have a different moral code for themselves and society [Agent vs society moralism](/notes/agent-vs-society-moralism.md). It's a form of [Moral Hazard](/notes/shirky-principle.md), because if people can take without giving, why shouldn't they?

Often an [Econs](/notes/econs.md) can become a free rider, because it serves the individual's self interest to do so. Obligations, duties , and morality are of little importance to them.
