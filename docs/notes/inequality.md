# Inequality

## Notes

Inequality is when two or more members have difference share of resources, rights, liberties, etc...
Usually, this is referred in a negative context. Meaning inequality is bad, and caused by unjust means [Justice](/notes/justice.md).
Often, when we try to solve inequality, the first challenge we face is what kind of inequality are we talking about, and accordingly, how could we solve it.
For example, a debate between left-right economical views is the difference between equality in results vs equality in opportunities. The first care that there are poor people, the second care whether they simply had the opportunity not to become poor.

Whether people are able or not to escape their financial situation is a tough question. On the surface, there is nothing that stands in their way [Negative freedom](/notes/negative-freedom.md), no one forces poor to be poor, and no law prevents them from rising above their station. However, some would claim that they lack the capability to do so [Positive freedom](/notes/positive-freedom.md). That they lack the education, the social status, and the tools necessary to escape poverty, so while nobody forces them to be poor, they are in a system that makes their situation permeant.

Economics has always been about the system it creates, and not individual people [Systematical Thinking](/notes/systematical-thinking.md), so we need to see what are the effects of the [capitalist](/notes/capitalism.md) system that we have in place.

Inequality has a larger impact than just the share of the resources. The less equal a society, the more we have a [us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md) mentality. Inequality separates society into groups based on financial status, and as the gap gets bigger, it becomes more [obvious](/notes/visibility.md) that we are very different from one another, that our lives are so different that it is almost as if we are living in a different world, speaking a different language. The greater the gap, the less they can [empathize](/notes/empathy.md) with each other. The more inequality we have, the less social wealth, less solidarity, less [Trust](/notes/trust.md), and less [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md) within the society, which makes everybody worse off.
