# Growth Mindset

## Notes

we are not pure [Objectivity](/notes/objectivity.md) - we are not an inmate object that stays the same throughout it's lifetime. **We have the ability to change who we are, what we think, and what we do**. [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md)

Growth mindset is the belief that:
1. **You are more than your actions** - your actions do not define who you are. [Failure](/notes/failure.md) doesn't make you a loser. [What we do is not who we are](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md).
2. **Personal growth is always possible** - Your skills, intelligence, and behavior are not set in stone. you can always learn and improve. [Lifelong Learning](/notes/lifelong-learning.md)
3. **Your inner self is more important than your image** - The only [comparison](/notes/comparisons.md) that matters is who you are today vs who you were yesterday, while thinking about who you could be tomorrow. Don't compare yourself to others, and don't let other's opinions define you. [form vs essence](/notes/form-vs-essence.md).

Sometimes having a growth mindset requires us to take a [Leap Into Faith](/notes/leap-into-faith.md), because it is believing that no matter who we are right now, we could be better, that changing ourselves, even (or especially) the parts that we don't like, is possible [Optimism](/notes/optimism.md). It means to see beyond our current situation, not ignoring the evidence, but also not letting them take control of our lives [is vs ought](/notes/is-vs-ought.md).

How do adapt a growth mindset:
1. **Try and try again** - improvement comes from practicing and failing over and over again, until we eventually get better [fake it till you make it](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md)
2. **Don't beat yourself up** - remember that you are not their *yet*. Your failures don't define you, they help you grow, they are part of the [process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), so practice [Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md), trusting that you are capable enough to change.
