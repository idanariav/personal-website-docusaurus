# Matching

## Notes

Matching is often the result of [Experimentation](/notes/testing.md). It is to find something that is the best option you can find, while also being the best option for the other party. For example, finding a partner, a job. It requires time and repetition to find a good option. Note that it doesn't necessarily mean you have to settle only for the best possible match. First of all, you won't likely know the best option even if you meet it, because it requires of you to test all possible options. Second, it is a matter of trusting that you have found something that is good enough [Perfect is the enemy of good](/notes/perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good.md), that answers your needs and advances you towards your goals.
