# Intrinsic Motivation

## Notes

Intrinsic motivation is when we feel [passionate](/notes/passion.md) about something, that we want to do it for [internal](/notes/intrinsic.md) reasons rather than [Instrumental](/notes/instrumental.md) reasons such as money, status or rewards.

Most often, intrinsic motivation is [croweded out](/notes/crowding-out.md) by [External Motivation](/notes/external-motivation.md). Not only that they cancel each other out, they are also not equal in quality. Intrinsic motivation is a much more powerful, stable and sustainable form of motivation. and it is the only way to protect ourselves from [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md).

To cultivate intrinsic motivation, you can:
1. **Follow your curiosity** - Give yourself time throughout the day to simply follow your [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md) and see where it takes you. Don't think about "spending the time wisely" or "Is it useful", let yourself "waste time" exploring, like finding gold, the important discoveries are worth the hours of searching.
2. **Find your purpose** - we are [sense seeking creatures](/notes/sense-seeking-creatures.md), we need a reason for our actions, a purpose for our lives. When we find that [purpose](/notes/lifes-mission.md), that things that is an embodiment of who we are and what we want to create in life, a fire is lit within us, we are filled with energy.
3. **Make it fun** - Despite our best intentions, it's hard to "force" ourselves to authentically want to do something. However, we can make it easier for us by making it [fun](/notes/gamification.md). A joyful activity can easily become something that we have a genuine desire to do repeatably.
