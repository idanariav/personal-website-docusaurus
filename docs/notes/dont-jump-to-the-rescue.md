# Don't Jump to the Rescue

## Notes

If we truly want to help someone, we should not always jump to their rescue every time they feel that they're in a crisis, this is because:
1. **Agency** - - a person who learns that someone else is always their to fix their problems either won't believe in their own [Competence](/notes/competence.md), won't develop it because they hadn't had a chance to practice it, or won't think it's relevant to try because they are not used to the concept of [Life Embracing](/notes/will-to-power.md) in their own lives. They won't have [Agency](/notes/agency.md) in their lives because we take it from them by solving their problems. Also, they would lack [Self esteem](/notes/self-worth.md), because by rescuing them we act as if they are incompetent and can't save themselves. We are teaching them to be [helpless](/notes/helplessness.md)
2. **Empathy** - when we jump quickly to the logical side, trying to solve problems as a form of care, we fail to [connect](/notes/empathy.md) with the other person, to truly [listen](/notes/active-listening.md) to them, understand them and share their pain, we ignore it and focus completely on the problem, skipping the interaction entirely. Most often what other's need most from us is [Validation](/notes/validation.md), not problem solving

In the end, while you perhaps have the best intentions in the world, to solve someone's problems is a form of [Micro-Management](/notes/micro-management.md), with all the damages it brings. It is also similar to a [Short term bias](/notes/present-bias.md), we prefer to have a quick fix right now, than help them solve it themselves so that they will be more capable later on.
