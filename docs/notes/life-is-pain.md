# Life is Pain

## Notes

Pain in life is unavoidable. There is endless [Randomness](/notes/randomness.md) that can affect our life, people who do bad things (from various reasons), and things outside of our control. If we [expect](/notes/expectations.md) a life without pain, it would be our biggest mistake. Even those who believe that the world is governed by a benevolent god have to accept that evil exists in the world.

To try and control every aspect in life to avoid suffering is [wishful](/notes/manifesting.md) thinking. [rejecting](/notes/denial.md) life as they are would only bring more pain. Perhaps it's the saddest irony that by trying to avoid pain, we only cause ourselves more of it. We have a part in our pain too, no matter the external circumstances, it is our [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) that translate events into emotions. To hurt is a choice, sometimes an acceptable one, yet it is still our choice.

For example, we don't control (to an extent) whether we are hurt in an accident, get cancer, or lose a family member. Yet, to become a [victim](/notes/helplessness.md), to dwell in that pain for years, letting it take over our lives, is our choice.
