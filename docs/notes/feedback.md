# Feedback

## Notes


### Claim

Feedback is one of the main ways to improve our (or others) behavior, by providing information.

### Explanation

The aspects of feedback are:
1. **Quality** - there are different levels of feedback, each better than the previous:
	1. **Result** - either a v/x (success or failure), or a score. This is only indicates the quality of your knowledge [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md). Like knowing how fast you finished a 10k race, or whether you passed a test without seeing any additional information.
	2. **Informative** - indicates exactly what you did or didn't do well, but not how to improve
	3. **Constructive** - Indicates what went well and what didn't, but also includes steps for [improvement](/notes/constructive-criticism.md).
2. **Time** - It is best if it occurs as close as possible to the act itself, before we [Forget](/notes/forgetfulness.md) what we did, or which tips we had for that behavior.
3. **Clarity** - The more precise, actionable and detailed the feedback, the better [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md)
4. **Mentoring** - Often it is too hard to give feedback to ourselves, either because we don't know how to improve because we lack the expertise, or because we are too focused on doing the action, that we can't spare mental resources on how exactly we did it. Therefore the best way to get feedback is either with a [Mentor](/notes/mentor.md) or with [peers](/notes/peer-support.md)

### Why it matters

Therefore without feedback, it is very difficult to improve. So despite it being very hard to hear and accept feedback, it is essential to our growth.

### Examples

### Supporters

The concept of feedback is based on several assumptions:
1. **We can do better** - [growth](/notes/growth-mindset.md) is always possible, after all, if your skills are fixed, what's the point in hearing how you could do better, like telling someone that they would fly better if they had wings.
2. **Practice makes perfect** - It is highly unlikely that we will do our best at the [first](/notes/first-batch-trash.md) try. Because improvement is based mainly on [experience](/notes/learning-by-doing.md), and it takes many iterations to reach a satisfying level of [Mastery](/notes/mastery.md), which couldn't be achieved through theoretical reasoning alone. [Practice beats perfection](/notes/practice-beats-perfection.md). Additionally, it means that practice matters much more than our raw talent, because the talent would only determine our starting point, but practice will determine how far we can go [Practice beats talent](/notes/practice-beats-talent.md).
