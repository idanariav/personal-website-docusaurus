# Proactiveness

## Notes

Proactiveness is when we take matter into our own hands. We refuse to see ourselves as [victims](/notes/helplessness.md) of circumstances, and we do what we can to change them. In order to be proactive, we first must have [Agency](/notes/agency.md), because there is no sense in saying that we are actively progressing towards our goals, if we don't have the capacity to choose.

Proactiveness is the embodiment of our [Will to Power](/notes/will-to-power.md), the combination of [Focus](/notes/focus.md), determination, and [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md), since every action requires a goal it is trying to complete, and without self knowledge we have no compass, no direction to follow. It is a trait that represents [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md), a touch of [Optimism](/notes/optimism.md) and the rejection of [is vs ought](/notes/is-vs-ought.md). We know that change is possible, we imagine a better future, and work towards it.

often proactiveness is a sign that we are fueled by [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md), that a fire burns within us so bright that it drives us into action.

Proactiveness can sometimes be a form of [Prevention](/notes/prevention.md), because we don't wait for things to fail or until someone forces us to do things, we do them right away when they are still manageable.

Proactiveness is the opposite of [Reactance](/notes/reactance.md), we don't react to a situation, we respond to it. We don't let ourselves be [hijacked](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md) by emotions, rather we use them as information, as tools [Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md) to strengthen our actions, rather than altering them.
