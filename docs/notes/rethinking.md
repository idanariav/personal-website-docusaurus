# Rethinking

## Notes

To rethink means to reevaluate what you thought you know and reach different conclusions, this is different than just "thinking more" about a subject, and it's perhaps one of the most difficult things to do because it requires us to admit that we were wrong. It's more than just having the [capabilities](/notes/critical-thinking.md) of reaching a good conclusion, it's the openness to initiate the process.

The more our identity is [tied](/notes/cognitive-alignment.md) to what we had believed or done, the harder it is to change it. To rethink something requires [humility](/notes/humility.md) to accept that we made a mistake, and be with an [open mind](/notes/beginners-mind.md) like a researcher [scientific method](/notes/scientific-method.md), to reexamine what we believe in, knowing that everything is true up until it is proven false, and to be ready to reform a new theory based on that.

It requires us to abandon what we think we [already know](/notes/curse-of-knowledge.md) as to not be limited by it. Usually our ways of thinking match certain [Problems](/notes/problems.md), which means we will always offer the same type of solution. Rethinking means to switch to a different viewpoint to allow different ways of solving the same problem. For example, firefighters in a large fire were told to drop their tools so that they could run for their lives, yet many kept them with them because of their long training that drilled into them the importance of tools, only for them to suffer the consequences of running slower.

The first step for rethinking is always to take a [Break](/notes/rest.md), and [slow down](/notes/slowing-down.md)

If rethinking involves beliefs and values, this can often trigger a moment of [Identity Discovery](/notes/identity-discovery.md)
