# Multitrack

## Notes

Multitrack is when we decide to spend more time on a task because we want to brainstorm and generate multiple alternatives, rather than picking only a [single](/notes/binary-thinking.md) option.

The advantages are:
1. **Cognitive distancing** - When we get criticized/feedback for our single solution, we often get defensive or ignore it, but when we have created multiple solutions, we are less [Attachment](/notes/attachment.md) to each one, more [distanced](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md), and thus more able to accept and apply [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md)
2. **Exploration** - our first solution is often the "[obvious](/notes/first-batch-trash.md)" one, a more basic/simplistic solution. Forcing us to think about a second or a third will increase chances of [creativity](/notes/innovation.md).
3. **Parallel improvements** - each solution can be an answer to the drawbacks of the other ones, thus when a drawback is found, it is not a step backwards, but rather forward for a different solution.
4. **Comparison** - by having multiple options, it is easier to compare, get perspective, and identity flaws in each version. [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md)

This idea supports the notion of [practice beats perfection](/notes/practice-beats-perfection.md), that it is hardly likely that we would be able to find the best solution on the first try/idea we have, so generating multiple options gives us higher certainty for success. This is also related to the idea of [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md), in many cases finding a single metric that covers all options/potential uses is very difficult if not impossible, one reason could be [Goodhart‚Äôs Law](/notes/goodhart‚Äôs-law.md). Using multiple options increases the [richness](/notes/complexity.md) of our method, which enables us to create a better proxy, while avoiding more of the disadvantages.
