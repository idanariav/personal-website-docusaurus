# Solitude

## Notes

Solitude is different from [Loneliness](/notes/loneliness.md), it's a type of isolation, not necessarily a physical one, that provides us time for [introspection](/notes/introspection.md). By removing the outside [Noise](/notes/noise.md) ) we are able to clear our mind (Aka:: [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md) and stay clear from [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md) and obtain [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md) about our goals, desires and identity.

While we never want to be alone, we all need moments of solitude for self development and wellbeing.

Solitude is also useful for [Ideation](/notes/ideation.md), by allowing us to activate our [downtime brain](/notes/downtime-brain.md).

Common methods for solitude can be [Meditation](/notes/meditation.md) and [Nature walk](/notes/nature-walk.md)
