# The Spotlight Effect

## Notes
- The Spotlight Effect is a common psychological phenomenon where we overestimate the degree to which other people are noticing or observing our actions, behaviors, appearance, or results. [We can't read minds](/notes/theory-of-mind.md)
- Two simple takeaways:
  1.  We think everyone is staring and noticing us, but they aren't.
  2. Even if they are, they quickly forget about it.

This means that we don't have to worry so much about our image because it doesn't have as much as an effect on others as we think we have, therefore we are free to act authentically [Image vs core](/notes/form-vs-essence.md). Also this means that our [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md) should have less meaning in our eyes. If nobody is watching our every move, if no one would notice if we have a stain on our shirt, or if we wear the same shirt for 2 days, then we should be less impacted by external expectations.
