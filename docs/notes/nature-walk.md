# Nature Walk

## Notes

Nature is an inseparable part of who we are, which makes the modern era where nature is more and more rare, and [distractions](/notes/attention-economy.md) are more and more common all the more difficult for ourselves and our wellbeing.

To bring back nature into our lives, the least we can do is to initiate nature walks. A walk in a park, a trip somewhere outside the city, or even sitting outside in the yard staring at a tree. We can't treat this walk as a side-activity, we can't listen to music, watch videos, or anything that will take away our ability to [Focus](/notes/focus.md). A useful nature walk requires mental [Solitude](/notes/solitude.md) and [mindfulness](/notes/intentionality.md), not necessarily a physical one.

Nature walk is a good way to recharge and heal our mental state, brining us back to a calm, happy, steady state, with fewer [Stress](/notes/stress.md), and lets our mind wonder and process our thoughts [Downtime brain](/notes/downtime-brain.md).

Connecting with nature is a good way to take a [Break](/notes/rest.md) and recharge, to feel a sense of [Resonance](/notes/resonance.md) with the world, and improve our wellbeing [Happiness is contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md).
