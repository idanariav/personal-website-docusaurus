# Contextual Synergy

## Notes

Some actions, such as learning and working will have a much higher rate of return if done in a [Context](/notes/context.md) that connects between what we are doing, and our needs, our desires at that moment.

For example, learning a new language when we are about to move abroad is a contextual synergy, since our desire to learn it and retain that information is much stronger than if we would have tried to learn it "for fun" anytime else.
Similarly, reading books that are related to experiences or thoughts you are having right now will be much more beneficial than reading self help books that solves challenges you aren't facing right now.

This reminds me of [motivational scheduling](/notes/motivational-scheduling.md) which connects between our internal desires to the actions we are trying to fulfill, but this is more related to value we get from it instead of having the motivation for it.

Note that there is no reason to use this as a justification for [Procrastination](/notes/procrastination.md). Waiting until the perfect context arrives is usually more damaging than beneficial. **It is better to create the context you need, instead of waiting for it**.

This can also be a useful method to decide how to preform [Triage](/notes/triage.md) on our tasks.

To do things in the best opportunity to maximize effectiveness. Good timing creates [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md), while bad timing creates [Friction](/notes/friction.md). Good timing is dependent on:
1. **mental preparedness** - mindset, knowledge, awareness to opportunities, circumstances (if it is an active problem)
2. **physical preparedness** - [Sleep](/notes/sleep.md), [fitness](/notes/fitness.md), [Nutrition](/notes/nutrition.md)
3. **resources** - things that can aide us, books, articles, objects (aka [reserves](/notes/reserves.md)), technology
