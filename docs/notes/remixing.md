# Remixing

## Notes

Perhaps all that creativity really is is remixing. There's nothing [new](/notes/innovation.md) under the sun, the best we can do is to mix together existing ideas in a new way that would be innovative enough to be considered as creative.

Remixing is highly connected to [Imitation](/notes/imitation.md), because in order to effectively use someone else's in combination with other ideas require us to understand it, or at least be able to replicate the process. Similarly, it is also related to [Transferred Learning](/notes/transferred-learning.md), because they both share the aspect of using knowledge from one context to another, yet the difference is that transferred learning uses the same logic, while remixing takes just bits and pieces and combines it with other forms of knowledge.

Good remixing recognizes that ideas are [medium independent](/notes/medium-independent.md), that they are not limited to where they were created and can be used in a different way. It also involves the ability to [distill](/notes/distillment.md) the core idea such that it could be combined with others.
