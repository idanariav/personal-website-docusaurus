# Specialization

## Notes

Specialization is when a person chooses or is assigned a certain task and he learns to do that task specifically very well. Meaning, that he prioritizes a narrow and deep view rather than wide and shallow. Usually, when you specialize at something, this becomes your [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md), but is also dependent on the type of competition around you. If you are specialized in a very common and easy-to-master field, then you will still be highly replaceable.
This idea has arisen in the time of the industrial revolution, mainly by [Adam Smith](/notes/adam-smith-philosopher.md) book of wealth of nations.
