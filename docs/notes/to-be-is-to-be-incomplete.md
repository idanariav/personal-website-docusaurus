# To Be is to Be Incomplete

## Notes

We are always in the process of becoming. Hopefully what we are trying to become is something we could be proud of, something we hope to be, values we want to embody [transcendence](/notes/transcendence.md).

This means that we will never be a "finished product", never end our todo-list, never reach our goals because even if we do, by the time we reach it either we have changed, or there are new goals to reach. Therefore we should [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md), knowing that it's the journey, not the destination that matters. But most of all it requires [Acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md) of our limitations, of who we are, and that we are beings limited by time, mental capacity, that lives in an ever changing environment. Hoping to be complete is as useless as trying to stop a river, by stopping it we have killed it [Life as Flow](/notes/life-as-flow.md).
