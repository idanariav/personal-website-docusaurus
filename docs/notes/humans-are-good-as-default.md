# Humans Are Good as Default

## Notes

researches show that we have tendency towards [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md), [Kindness](/notes/giving.md) and [Trust](/notes/trust.md) as default. Our negative behavior is *learned*, not inherit in our nature [nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md). Meaning that we are we are [born to love](/notes/love-what-is-good.md) , yet learn to hate. Since "good" qualities are in many cases synonymous with qualities that relates to how we interact with others, saying that we are born good is similar to saying that we are born as a social creature [human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md)

That is why it is easy to motivate people through non material means, through shared values, culture and goals instead of monetary incentives because it aligns better with our deep preferences [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md). Similarly, cultivating these values in others is more accurately described as helping them discover their core self rather than changing them [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md).

Those who live their lives guided by love and have an [optimistic](/notes/optimism.md) view of human kindness, often describe [Life as Flow](/notes/life-as-flow.md), a feeling of connection with the world and with others, of [Oneness](/notes/unity.md).
