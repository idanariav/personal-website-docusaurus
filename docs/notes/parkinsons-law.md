# Parkinson's Law

## Notes

A task will take as much time as you give it.
That means that we are more prone to [Procrastination](/notes/procrastination.md) if we have control on our schedule, meaning that the task is not with a hard deadline, or if the deadline is very far into the future.

But the reverse is true as well, if we give ourselves a very short deadline we can perhaps finish the task quickly, by using methods such as [the five minute rule](/notes/5-minute-rule.md).
