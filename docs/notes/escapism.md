# Escapism

## Notes

Escapism is like a deep personal [Distraction](/notes/distraction.md). When chosen, often subconsciously, to avoid doing or facing something by focusing on something else. For example, a person with a failing marriage might double down on their career.

Escapism often leads to a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md). By avoiding our problems and focusing on something else, we usually intensify those problems. We choose [Denial](/notes/denial.md) over [actively](/notes/proactiveness.md) trying to solve them. It is a form of [Present Bias](/notes/present-bias.md), where we push our troubles to future us for gaining some peace in the present. For example, trying to drown our emotions over a bad relationship with alcohol will only worsen the state of our relationship, which will increase the need for more alcohol, and so on. It could transform into a harmful [Addiction](/notes/addiction.md), will lead to bad [Positioning](/notes/compounding.md), and can easily lead to [Depression](/notes/depression.md).

We embrace [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md) by believing that the situation is too much to handle, that it's bigger than us, that it will destroy us.

A common escapism which seems harmless and even nice at first is [Nostalgia](/notes/nostalgia.md), we focus on the "good times" we had, forgetting all the problems we had and try to revert ourselves back to our "happy place". Usually nostalgia is embedded in our childhood, when incidentally we were also safe and happy without a care in the world, exactly the place we want to be in now instead of facing the harsh reality.
