# Human Brain

## Notes

How does our brain operate? What is it's tendencies? it's structure?
how does it affect our thinking and our actions?

Neuroscience is the science that involves the study of the human brain, how it operates, what are the connections between our conscious [exprience](/notes/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness.md) and our biological system. [Mind-body connection](/notes/mind-body-connection.md)

Our mind has capabilities that could be highly beneficial to our productivity and having a routine that supports our well-being. From learning to creating new habits, understanding how our mind works is key to achieve anything in life.

The brain's main goal is efficient resource and energy management [Reserves](/notes/reserves.md). It is trying to [predict](/notes/prediction.md) what it might need in the future in order to be prepared in advance, based on what it needed in the past, this is what a habit is essentially [Habit formation](/notes/habit-formation.md). The way it prepares us is through our impulses, our motions. They are an attempt to get ready for a future "cost" on the body, to push us towards certain action or state [Emotions as information](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md). When it lacks reserves, it starts to shut down the non-urgent sections such as learning, critical thinking, and moral reasoning, killing neural connections that might never return.

Running the brain itself is very costly, about 20% of all our energy consumption goes to the brain. To make sure it has sufficient energy, it takes both [Sleep](/notes/sleep.md) and good [Nutrition](/notes/nutrition.md) to maintain it.

Mental health and physical health are intertwined. It's no surprise that depression causes heart disease and vice versa. All because the brain manages the body, it is forever connected to it. Moreover, our thinking is hardly limited to the physical brain, as much of it is related to our environment and our interactions with others [Extended Mind](/notes/extended-mind.md)

Our brain is anything but statis. It has proven that the brain has [Neuroplasticity](/notes/neuroplasticity.md), which means it can adapt, we can learn new things, we can change the structure of our brain, and the wiring of specific pathways.
