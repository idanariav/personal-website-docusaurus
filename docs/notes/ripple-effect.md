# Ripple Effect

## Notes

Ripple effect is when an action spreads to new areas or people who continue on the effect long after the first action has passed. There could be positive and negative ripple effects.

For example, some problems, especially the more difficult ones, tend to spread and persist, such that even if you removed the root of the problem, its symptoms still exist, and perhaps have developed into problems of their own. for example, removing a person who created a bad work culture doesn't mean that the culture will correct itself once he's gone. [Path Dependence](/notes/path-dependence.md)

Similarly, when someone does a kind act towards another, it can cause that person to be kinder to other people as well, creating a chain reaction of [Kindness](/notes/giving.md). Behavior ripple effects are very strong and contagious due to the human tendency to [mirror](/notes/mirroring.md) one another, especially those closest to us. An action that triggers a good and effective ripple effect can have long lasting effects. The message becomes self sustaining, creating a [Resonance](/notes/resonance.md) that is transmitted between people and becomes a culture/norm. For example, someone can start a giving habit that promotes kindness within an organization. If that habit is strong, it can outlast the person who established it, and even after the first people who endorsed it, becoming a company culture that lingers on thanks to the act of one person.

Often these types of effects are less [visable](/notes/visibility.md), which means they are often not considered when making a decision. [zooming out](/notes/zoom-out.md) can help us see the greater picture and consider such effects. Finding the actions that use positive ripple effects to our advantage is one of the best ways to [optimize](/notes/optimization.md) our time and energy. On the personal level, an action with a ripple effect is similar to one that has a [compounding](/notes/compounding.md) effect, because the act carry itself forward without us having to add additional effort. It is also similar to the [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md) effect, because it increases the effectiveness of the action. 

Considering the ripple effect of our actions reminds [categorical imperative](/notes/categorical-imperative.md), because we don't just take our own case into account, rather we consider the broad implications of it.
