# Impulsivity

## Notes

Impulsivity is similar to [Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md), although it is not always as powerful. Sometimes we act impulsively simply due to a lack of [thinking](/notes/intentionality.md), which means that even a weak [Desire](/notes/desire.md) can make the decisions for us because it is the only consideration there is.

Usually the problem with impulsivity is that it leads to a [Short term bias](/notes/present-bias.md). We focus on immediate benefits while ignoring or forgetting long-term consequences. Our impulsive behavior, while appearing genuine, is often just a behavior that pushes us towards [Distractions](/notes/procrastination.md) and activities that fail to represent the type of life we want [Akrasia](/notes/akrasia.md).

However, impulsivity might also be similar to [Leap Into Faith](/notes/leap-into-faith.md), that we overcome a barrier for action by shutting off our rational side, and letting our emotions and beliefs take the wheel.
