# External Motivation

## Notes

External motivation is when we [Desire](/notes/desire.md) something as a [means](/notes/instrumental.md) to something else, not in it's own right. Usually it involves someone who offers us these benefits as [rewards](/notes/incentives.md) if we commit this action. For example, most of us work for money, and not for the pleasure of productivity. Status, recognition and reputation are often examples of external motivation.

There are many problems with external motivation. The main ones are:
1. **It crushes "good" motivation** - It [crowds out](/notes/crowding-out.md) [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md). When we are offered tangible rewards such as money or status for completing something, it extinguishes softer, more abstract reasons such as passion, enjoyment or [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md) for performing the same action. It turns us into [Econs](/notes/econs.md) that view the world in a transactional way. External rewards essentially try to [commodifie](/notes/commodification.md) motivation into a matter of transaction.
2. **No rewards = no motivation** - Once these rewards stop, we lose all motivation to continue with that action, meaning that they create [Dependency](/notes/dependency.md) rather than cultivate motivation.
3. **It backfires** - Promising a reward for completing an action usually makes us worse off at performing that action. A reward shifts our attention to it rather than the action, limiting our ability to experience [Flow](/notes/flow.md) and doing it well, while also encouraging us to do as little as possible while meeting the criteria for getting the reward [Goodhart’s Law](/notes/goodhart’s-law.md).
