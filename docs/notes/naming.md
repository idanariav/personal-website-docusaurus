# Naming

## Notes

when we name a phenomenon, we gain [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md), we suddenly "see it everywhere" and find it easier to process and connect to other concepts. Philosophy is more often providing tools through naming rather than direct answers.

While internally naming provides clarity, the situation is more complex when we turn to communication. According to [structuralism](/notes/structuralism.md), the meaning of words is depends on [Context](/notes/context.md) that is ever changing, which means this can cause cases of misunderstanding if we use a work that is unfamiliar to someone else because they don't share our social environment, or worse, when they think they understood what we meant by that, when we actually meant something utterly different.
