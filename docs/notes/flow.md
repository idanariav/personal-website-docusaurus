# Flow

## Notes

Flow is described as the situation of a perfect immersed experienced, in which we forget ourselves and [Focus](/notes/focus.md) solely on the task at hand, performing at [peak](/notes/optimization.md) efficiency, and experiencing great joy from it [Unity](/notes/unity.md). We feel connected to it, as if it is part of who we are [Alienation](/notes/alienation.md). Our mind [quiets](/notes/intentionality.md) down and the task consumes the entirety of our thoughts (or we have no thoughts at all)

the flow experience is achieved when:
1. **the task is challenging** - on the borderline between boredom and anxiety (not too easy, not too hard). [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md)
2. **The task has clear goals and visible feedback** [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md)
3. **We find purpose in the task** - We have [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) to fulfill this task, we find purpose in it or see it as something that is an expression of ourselves.
4. **We have agency** - It is hard to be in flow in an experience that is pure [Luck](/notes/luck.md), that we have no control over. Usually it involves at least some kind of [Agency](/notes/agency.md), that we have something to do, that we can affect it through our actions.
