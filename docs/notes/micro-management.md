# Micro-Management

## Notes

Micro management is a form of over supervision and control, one that leaves no room for the individual to make decisions, the manager tracks and dictates every move. This [removes](/notes/crowding-out.md) [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md), increases [Stress](/notes/stress.md) for both sides, and hurts productivity, which is ironically the opposite of what it tries to achieve [The law of reverse effect](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md).

When we try to micro manage someone, we signal that we don't [Trust](/notes/trust.md) them to make good decisions on their own. We treat them as incompetent, as [objects](/notes/objectivity.md), as tools to be used, which could become a [Self fulfilling prophecy](/notes/fake-it-till-you-make-it.md). They will internalize our low [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) of them, believing that they are truly [worthless](/notes/self-worth.md). Another way in which micro management hurts productivity is by increasing the chance of [Reactance](/notes/reactance.md). When people feel like they are being controlled and manipulated, they tend to fight back. So instead of working [together](/notes/cooperation.md) for a common cause, we get a [conflict](/notes/organizational-conflict.md).
