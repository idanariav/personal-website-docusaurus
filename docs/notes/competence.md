# Competence

## Notes

Where does talent come from? are we born with it? Recent research suggests otherwise. What appears to us as natural talent is "just" a matter of practice and attitude. In this case, the [Nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md) debate is settled on the "nurture" side. Often those who appear as genius are a result of a long process of [Deliberate Practice](/notes/deliberate-practice.md) which has started in a young age, with the combination of [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md).

This is good news because it means that many skills are "suddenly" approachable, and it gives justification for [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md), as long as we are able to dedicate time and have [Grit](/notes/grit.md) for pursuing [Mastery](/notes/mastery.md) in this field.

Being competent, regardless of it's source, provides [Confidence](/notes/self-worth.md) in oneself. Yet having "too much" of it, especially in early ages where the gap is more visible can lead to [Over confidence](/notes/over-confidence.md). Also we have to remember that competence can be perceived as a type of [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md), which means we have to work hard just to stay in the same relative position compared to others [Red queen syndrome](/notes/red-queen-syndrome.md)
