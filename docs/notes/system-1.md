# System 1

## Notes

System 1 is more known as our automated thinking, or the emotional side. It is the source of our [Instincts](/notes/heuristics.md). System 1 is tied deeply to our [Amygdala](/notes/amygdala.md), which is the primal side of our brain, it often triggers automatic behavior such as fight or flight, and causes us to feel emotions such as [Passion](/notes/passion.md) [Anger](/notes/anger.md) [Fear](/notes/fear.md) [Stress](/notes/stress.md). As opposed with [System 2](/notes/system-2.md) which represents our higher, analytical thinking.

System 1 is not a "design flaw", nor does it lacks importance. Although much of it's effect is about supporting [Impulsivity](/notes/impulsivity.md), it's meant to protect ourselves. Back when danger was immediate and we had to respond instantly, those who stopped and analyzed the situation before hand were gone. Besides, our mind is an efficient resource management, we need a system that contains automatic instructions rather than thinking about everything from scratch each time.

System one is beneficial for:
1. **Social awareness** - much of our modern "dangers" are about our social status. We fear exclusion, we wish to be accepted, and we worry about how we present ourselves. While they can often be too much, emotions are important conveyers of [information](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md). Without it we would lack the energy and desire to act socially, to express selflessness.
2. **Habits** - when a behavior is [automated](/notes/habit-formation.md), it transfers from system 2 to system 1. Without it we wouldn't be able to maintain positive habits.
