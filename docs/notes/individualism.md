# Individualism

## Notes

Individualism is the focus on the individual as the smallest unity of [Moral worth](/notes/moral-worth.md) and of thinking capacity, as opposed to more social views that look at the community as the smallest unit. It separates us both technically and psychologically from others [Unity](/notes/unity.md)

Individualism somewhat rejects the notion of [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md), and claims that at least on some level, there is an independent core to each person.

Individualism doesn't support [Giving](/notes/giving.md), or at least only partially overlaps because by giving others we leave less for ourselves, and since our wellbeing is measured by how much utility we provide us and not others, then by giving we reduce our potential of overall wellbeing.
