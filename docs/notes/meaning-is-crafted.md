# Meaning is Crafted

## Notes

Meaning, or purpose to our lives is not something that we are born with, and even on that case, we have no way of knowing what our purpose in life is. Therefore, in either case our purpose has to be decided, we have to define, plan and declare our purpose [Life's Mission](/notes/lifes-mission.md) [Pragmatism](/notes/pragmatism.md). Without it, we are simply [lost in the infinite](/notes/lost-in-the-infinite.md), unable to take control of the way our life is headed because we don't know where we are going.

Since we are our own unique person, we can't copy another's purpose [lost in the finite](/notes/lost-in-the-finite.md). We have to dive deep [introspection](/notes/introspection.md), find our [Passion](/notes/passion.md), and cultivate our [authentic self](/notes/authenticity.md).

It is okay to not be sure about your purpose even after you have decided it, since it can and probably will change over time [Intertemporal Identity](/notes/intertemporal-identity.md), and it is okay to include other's in our meaning of life, as long as they don't decide for us what that meaning will be [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md)
