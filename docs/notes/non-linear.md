# Non Linear

## Notes

Many things in life, including life itself is not linear. Although we are [sense seeking creatures](/notes/sense-seeking-creatures.md), life doesn't always have a logic behind it, nor a clear linear path.

The only certainly is that [life is change](/notes/life-is-change.md), nothing remains constant, so we can't expect life to be in a straight line. We will fail, we will change our mind, [unexpected](/notes/randomness.md) things will happen, so we can never know our path in advance [prediction](/notes/prediction.md), only at hindsight at best.

Some things, like [compounding](/notes/compounding.md) have a non linear pattern. Things that happen beneath the surface and then suddenly bursts out with great presence.
