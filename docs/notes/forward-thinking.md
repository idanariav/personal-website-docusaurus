# Forward Thinking

## Notes

Whenever we face a [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md), we can either dwell on the past, filling ourselves with [Blame](/notes/blame.md) or [regret](/notes/regret.md) for failing to meet our [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md), or we can focus on the road ahead, what we can do now and how we can act better next time [Optimism](/notes/optimism.md).

While the first view hurts our [self worth](/notes/self-worth.md) and promotes [victimhood](/notes/helplessness.md), this empowers it, focusing on our [agency](/notes/agency.md).
