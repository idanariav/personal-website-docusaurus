# Exploration Vs Exploitation

## Notes

how should you divide your time between exploring new things or sticking to the "tried and true"? [Ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md) is relevant here, which causes us to be unsure [When to quit](/notes/when-to-quit.md).
but as a general rule:
1. always keep a minimal level of exploration, to introduce new experiences and possible welfare to your life. [Lifelong Learning](/notes/lifelong-learning.md) [Biological mutations 2bc](/notes/biological-mutations-2bc.md)
2. the less important or the shorter the future of acting in this area, the better it is to exploit the existing knowledge.

Another way of looking at it is though the concept of navigation vs pathfinding.
When we pathfind, we explore, we debate where we want to go, who do we want to be.
When we navigate, we know exactly where we want to go, we don't consider any other destinations, we narrow our focus to reach this destination.
