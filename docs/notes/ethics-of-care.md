# Ethics of care

## Notes

originated from the difference in moral reasoning between men and women. men tended to stick to logical rational reasoning, either based on rules [Deontology](/notes/deontology.md) or mathematical calculations [Utilitarianism](/notes/utilitarianism.md), both trying to derive a one true answer for each moral dilemma.  
  
women however judged the situation from a different standpoint, which we now call ethics of care. this view takes into consideration relationships and social obligations and connection between humans and the environment were we live.  

for example, kids were tested on a moral dilemma as follows:
your wife is sick and you don't have money for the medicine, is it justified to steal it?
men usually sticked to ultimatums, such as:
1. stealing is always wrong, I wont steal
2. human life is more valuable than the price of the medicine/harm to the vendor, it is justified to steal
women however gave answers like:
1. have we tried reasoning with the vendor?
2. what my wife would think of me if I steal it?
3. what good will it bring if I steal the medicine, only to be put in prison while she is better?

humans are not detached individual moral agents who decide in a vacuum as presented in moral dilemmas such as the trolly problem. humans make moral decisions in real life, and are affected and affecting real people. same as the dilemma changes when suddenly you are the one who has to push the person, or see those people die, would you really be able to? we are our connections, our family, society, friends, thinking of a moral agent as an individual first is a mistake.  
  
morality is intertwined with our emotions as humans, to detach from them or from your relations is to abandon humanity.  

### summary:
1. moral dilemmas are judged in "real life cases" based on how it affects our relations with our community, others, environment, etc..., issues of responsibility, empathy and compassion are intertwined.
2. there is no "one true answer" to each case
3. To be moral is to consider our emotions
  
### How to care:  
1. Notice you need to help (attentive)  
2. want to help (responsibility)  
3. can help (competence)  
4. help by their preferences (responsive)  
5. help inclusivity (plurality)
