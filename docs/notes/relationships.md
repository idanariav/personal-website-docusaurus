# Relationships

## Notes

To be deeply connected to someone means a connection that is built on[Honesty](/notes/honesty.md), [Trust](/notes/trust.md), [Active Listening](/notes/active-listening.md), [Transparency](/notes/transparency.md), [Kindness](/notes/giving.md) and [Empathy](/notes/empathy.md).

It's a connection where we acknowledge the differences we have, and we have come to appreciate them, to love them for who they are, and wish to maintain their sense of [Autonomy](/notes/agency.md).

It also means that we want to do what's best for them, not what's best for us. As hard as it might sound, helping them become who they want to be doesn't mean that it's our job to make them happy all the time. As a rule, we shouldn't [jump to their rescue](/notes/dont-jump-to-the-rescue.md), because solving their problems for them will only make them worse off at the end. Let them come to you and ask for [Advice](/notes/advice.md), but until then your role as a friend/partner/parent is to listen, to understand and to hug when needed

Relationship is a two way street. We can't expect the other to open up to us if we don't open ourselves to them. It is not only necessary, it is often based on the fact that we expose ourselves truly to the other [Vulnerability](/notes/vulnerability.md).
