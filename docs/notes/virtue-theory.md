# Virtue Theory

## Notes

As opposed to [Deontology](/notes/deontology.md) and [Utilitarianism](/notes/utilitarianism.md), according to virtue theory, **a good moral person is a person which posses and cultivates within him the right virtues**.
Virtues are both values and rules for behavior, therefore they serve as the best of both worlds. They include some of the rule based reasoning of deontology, while also caring for the final outcome like utilitarianism. While it does share the strengths of each view, since it does not focuses solely on one thing it can avoid most of it's flaws.

In deontology, the main issue is the lack of flexibility, everything is absolute - lying is always wrong, etc... but what if an murderer comes to your house and ask where are your kids? as mentioned in Greek philosophy - to make the right decision you need [context](/notes/context.md). You need to think about what it is you are truly doing by preforming this action in this very case.
For example, lying is bad, but not if it helps preventing murder which is clearly the worse outcomes.

Similarly, my main issue with utilitarianism is that you cant "trust it". Sure, it almost guarantees the best outcome in terms of overall happiness, but shouldn't that mean that we should butcher people in the street if their organs can save more people? The lack of reasons behind the action can sometimes cause our support for utilitarianism to be inconsistent.
Additionally, utilitarianism has an easier case in a world where all the outcomes are predefined and known, but what happens in cases of uncertainty? the math could easily fail since even knowing the probability for each of the outcomes could be beyond calculation.
In that case, we need reasons and the right motives more than ever.

**Virtue theory is perhaps the least satisfying moral code than the others, since you don't get an absolute predefined answer on what to do in each case, it doesn't make our life easy.**

There is temptation in [Simplicity](/notes/simplicity.md), because we usually tend to shay away from [Ambiguity](/notes/ambiguity.md). Simple
moral solutions such as "never lie", or a wellbeing calculation are tempting because we don't have to make an effort and think for ourselves what we should do, the answer is clear and we should just follow the rules. Instead, getting advice such as "be courageous, but not too much" sounds frustrating and unhelpful. How does that help us?

What seems as a disadvantage in virtue theory is actually a recognition of reality. It doesn't hide behind simple solutions that fail in real life. Morality is a [complex](/notes/complexity.md) matter because life is complex. We can never know the answer in advance, it relies on the context, on us, the people involved, and so many other small details that could never be translated to simple wellbeing numbers, or be captured in general rules.

Instead, it says that moral actions have to come from a virtuous person. **morality is not a textbook, but rather a never ending mission to become a better person** [transcendence](/notes/transcendence.md), to have unbiased reasons, to have an objective perception on reality [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md). To be more [kind](/notes/giving.md), [couragous](/notes/standing-up-for-yourself.md), [flexible](/notes/adaptability.md) and [moderate](/notes/balance-extremes.md).

Perhaps it's an unreachable goal, but it is the one that will put us closest to being a good person, and making good moral choices.
