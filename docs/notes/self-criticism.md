# Self Criticism

## Notes

Self Criticism is when we are our worst enemy, the opposite of [self talk](/notes/self-talk.md). When we criticize ourselves, we often lack [Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md), and we know exactly which buttons to push in order to make us feel bad about ourselves. We usually [judge](/notes/judgment.md) ourselves by unbelievable standards [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md), and while we call it criticism, it is far removed from [actual criticism](/notes/constructive-criticism.md) that can help us improve, the goal is not to support us, but rather damage us.

When we criticize ourselves, we damage our [self worth](/notes/self-worth.md), and ironically locks us in an [unchanging](/notes/fixed-mindset.md) state, unable to escape and become someone who doesn't deserve these criticisms. By saying things like "Why do I always do...", "Why I am so stupid...", or "I don't deserve happiness", we [attach](/notes/attachment.md) our failures to our identity, unable to gain enough distance to learn and grow from them. We tarnish our identity, rather than our actions, as if we are beings of pure incompetence and worthlessness. We have no [Safe Base](/notes/safe-base.md), no where to feel [validated](/notes/validation.md), no where to find the energy to escape our circumstances. Self criticism is a swamp that only grows deeper and harder to escape [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md). We criticize ourselves, so we feel bad, and eventually we will make more mistakes, which would lead to more criticism, more self hatred, more mistakes...
