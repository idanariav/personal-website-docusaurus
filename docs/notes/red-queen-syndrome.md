# Red Queen Syndrome

## Notes

The red queen syndrome is when we constantly have to [adapt](/notes/adaptability.md) just to stay in place. For example, having [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) won't necessarily improve your [Competitive Advantage](/notes/competitive-advantage.md) compared to others because they keep evolving and improving as well.

While you of course get better objectively, you don't necessarily improve in [comparison](/notes/comparisons.md) with others.

This means that we either constantly improve [Lifelong Learning](/notes/lifelong-learning.md) or we would stay behind.
