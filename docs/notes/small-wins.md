# Small Wins

## Notes

It is hard to maintain motivation when we don't see the fruits of our hard work. More than just [Visibility](/notes/visibility.md), we need to feel a sense of achievement before we can move forward. Even [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) requires something to hold onto. Therefore the best thing to do is to either have small wins right at the beginning of your journey, for example, some food places would offer you a punch card with the first mark already checked. Rationally, there's no difference between a 10-marks punch card or an 11 marks punch card with the first one already filled, but having this one already done gives us a sense of progress. This creates both motivation and [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md) Alternatively, having a list of achievements or challenges you’ve overcome is useful especially when times are hard, you can look at it and gain motivation.

Without a sense of accomplishment, we are prone to fall to [Self Criticism](/notes/self-criticism.md) for constant failings or [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md)
