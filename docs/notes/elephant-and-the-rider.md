# Elephant and the Rider

## Notes

One can envision our behavior as being made of two parts:
1. **The Rider** - this is our rational brain, our [System 2](/notes/system-2.md), where we wish to direct our life towards a certain purpose, to follow rules and best practices, to make educated decisions
2. **The Elephant** - This is our emotional brain, our [System 1](/notes/system-1.md), this is the part that provides us with the willpower and motivation to do as we wish, but sometimes towards goals that we wanted to avoid.
