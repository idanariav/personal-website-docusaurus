# Familiarity Bias

## Notes

Familiarity bias is when we are more [attached](/notes/attachment.md) to something simply because it is familiar to us. This is similar to the [Status-quo bias](/notes/status-quo-bias.md). We prefer the known simply because it is known even if it is far from the best we can have. This stems from out innate desire to avoid [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md).
