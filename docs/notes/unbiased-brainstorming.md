# Unbiased brainstorming

## Notes
It is difficult to *unknow* what we know 
[Curse of Knowledge](/notes/curse-of-knowledge.md). This is true either in cases we gain new knowledge ourselves, or when we interact with others get a glimpse to their opinion. So in order to avoid [Rationalization](/notes/rationalization.md) and [Group Thinking](/notes/social-environment.md), we need to explore our thoughts before we are exposed to other views/ideas. This includes:
1. **Dump** - Take out a blank sheet of paper. Write down what you know about the subject youâ€™re about to explore. This can either be before reading a book about it, hearing a podcast, before a meeting about the topic, etc.
2. **Adjust** -  During the learning/deliberation process, engage and confront the new information vs what you have already written, see how to incorporate the new information (if at all) to what you have already written down.
3. **Review** - After some time has passed, review the notes again and see if any new insights come up.

This method increases the chances for a creative output because you are less likely to be anchored to think like others, and it forces you to engage with the topic on a higher level.
