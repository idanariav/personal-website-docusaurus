# Trust

## Notes

Trust is when we are able to take someone at their word without suspicion, without assuming that there are hidden [motives](/notes/incentives.md), and that they will follow through on their promises. Trust between groups is similar, that we know we can act without [Fear](/notes/fear.md), that there is no [us vs them](/notes/us-vs-them.md) mentality, and that we experience [Psychological safety](/notes/psychological-safety.md), knowing that we are free to speak and be heard.

What makes people trustworthy?
1. **Authenticity** - They are [authentic](/notes/authenticity.md), we are aware of their preferences and code of ethics, and know what their goals are.
2. **Honest** - A person can only be trustworthy if they are [honest](/notes/honesty.md) with others and with themselves
3. **Integrity** - They follow through with their values. When they give a promise, we know that they will fulfill it [Integrity](/notes/integrity.md)

Sometimes we can't know in advance whether someone is trustworthy or not. Some claim that trust has to be gained. While it's true that trust is dependent on the repeated interaction between people, for example a person who keeps disappointing you is perhaps not trustworthy, but I also believe that as a default, we should trust others unless we have a clear reason not to [humans are good as default](/notes/humans-are-good-as-default.md).

Unfortunately, since trustworthiness is a trait with many benefits, some people will try to appear as trustworthy when they only try to take advantage of us. That's why when it comes to big decisions where trust is key and the potential damage from being betrayed is high, it is reasonable to ask for evidence that will help them [signal](/notes/signaling.md) that they really are trustworthy.

Having someone who we can trust in our lives is essential for our wellbeing. They can be our [Safe Base](/notes/safe-base.md), a place that we can come to for support and safety.
