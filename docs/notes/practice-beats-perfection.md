# Practice Beats Perfection

## Notes

The only, and best way to improve is through practice [Deliberate Practice](/notes/deliberate-practice.md). This goes against our innate and misguided perception that we should focus on [Perfectionism](/notes/perfectionism.md), that only by generating perfect outputs we would improve. Research shows that only [Consistency](/notes/consistency.md) brings better results as opposed to [Planning](/notes/planning.md) that only gets you so far.

This was disproved when students were asked to either take 100 photos as they wish, or try to have only 1 perfect photo. Not only that the first group had more photos, that's given, but they also had better photos! It might be also by chance, but most likely this is because they learned during the process and their [Failure](/notes/failure.md) gave them [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md) on how to improve and do better next time [First Batch Trash](/notes/first-batch-trash.md).

When we focus on generating as many experiences as possible instead of the "perfect one", we [increase](/notes/multitrack.md) the chance of finding or creating useful information.
