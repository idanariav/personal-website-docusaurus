# Deliberation

## Notes

Deliberation is the act of sharing [Perspective](/notes/subjective-reality.md) with one another, it is to bridge the gap created by the [Theory of Mind](/notes/theory-of-mind.md), and allow us to see through each other's eyes. A deliberation is not necessarily a tool for unifying our perceptions into one, but it is much more likely to reach an [understanding](/notes/active-listening.md), encourage [Cooperation](/notes/cooperation.md) and find [win win situations](/notes/win-win-situations.md). through deliberation while assuming

When we talk instead of [argue](/notes/debate.md), it is easier go pass the [Stereotypes](/notes/stereotypes.md). However, it is not always easy to do in the right way. First we have to assume [Neutrality](/notes/neutrality.md), although it's natural to prefer our side over theirs, there will be no agreement if we believe we hold all the moral righteousness and that we are always right. We have to fill ourselves with [Curiosity](/notes/curiosity.md), to really try to understand the other side, and come with more [questions](/notes/open-ended-questions.md) than answers.

Communicating in such a way is invigorating, it's [in our nature](/notes/communication-is-in-our-nature.md) to communicate with others, to help and rely on others for our wellbeing and coordinating our behavior in our lives.
