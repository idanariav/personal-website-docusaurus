# Caching

## Notes

Caching is the storage of information "in hand" to make it easier and faster to use next time [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md).
same as computers, we can also prepare our environment or habits to make sure that we give priority to the things we will need most [Environmental design](/notes/nudge.md).
the basic logic says:
1. **Proximity** - have the most usable things close at hand
2. **Hierarchy** - have a hierarchy of caching. For example a drawer, a closet, and a basement for storing stuff based on their chance of "usability"
3. **Relevance** - store things were they will most likely be kept
