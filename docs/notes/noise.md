# Noise

## Notes

Noise is all the external signals that are leading us [away](/notes/crowding-out.md) from the [Truth](/notes/truth.md) and confuses us. This can be statistically by expressing as an error that disrupts the trends and can cause errors of [fake correlations](/notes/correlation-is-not-causation.md). But also in the personal sense where we are bombarded by information [Attention Economy](/notes/attention-economy.md), and we have to learn to [filter](/notes/filtering.md) unhelpful, damaging, and simply wrong messages out of the quality ones.

It is important to remember that when it comes to noises, the [Pareto Principle](/notes/pareto-principle.md) usually applies, meaning that most of the noise is junk, and a small part of it is helpful. Also it is worth [distilling](/notes/distillment.md) it and actively filter it as to not let yourself be affected by the misleading part, to extract the good from the bland. Perhaps if we [align](/notes/resonance.md) ourselves with what we try to learn, a connection to the truth, to the basics, could be helpful with that.

Remember that noise might be extremally difficult in cases of [Conformation Bias](/notes/conformation-bias.md) where we listen to want we want to hear, not necessarily to what is true. And also, noise can be a result of [Randomness](/notes/randomness.md), which removes the value from the message.
