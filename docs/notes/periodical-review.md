# Periodical Review

## Notes

Periodical review is the idea that we should have a habit of [introspection](/notes/introspection.md) in our daily life. Since our day to day is usually full with changes, [Noise](/notes/noise.md), and focusing on the "now", we can often forget the long term, and since we are usually very busy, we lack [Focus](/notes/focus.md) on our inner world - values, emotions, etc. The same is true for our habits and goals, we might think we are on track when actually we have fallen behind.

A periodical review allows us to take a [Break](/notes/rest.md) and [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md), to see our life from greater distance, which gives us a chance to stop negative [Defaults](/notes/defaults.md), and start each period (whether a day/week/month...) with a [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md).

For example, the [Eisenhower matrix](/notes/eisenhower-matrix.md) is a good tool to use for seeing which activities take our time, measure their importance, and plan ahead accordingly what we should focus on, instead of what fights for our attention. Same can be done with habits, we can track our streak, see which positive or negative habits are maintained and which still needs adjustments in our to sink in.

Due to the constant noise and pressure we are under, doing a periodical review won't come naturally. we have to [block](/notes/time-blocking.md) time for it so that it won't get pushed aside. Doing periodical reviews consistently could be a [Multiplier](/notes/multiplier.md) for our productivity because we would focus on the important rather than noise, and would keep our habits on track [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md).
