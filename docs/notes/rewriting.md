# Rewriting

## Notes

We think that some aspects to our being is fixed. Such as our memories, and our identity. That at best, we can [cover](/notes/layering.md) up some of it, but it will forever stay that way.

However, science shows us that our past (memories, self) is not "saved" somewhere. Every time we try to access parts of ourselves, we constantly rewrite those based on our current [Context](/notes/context.md). For example, find out that your partner cheated on you can "suddenly" paint previous memories as full of suspicion and pain, although previously you considered these as good memories. It's not just our [Judgment](/notes/judgment.md) that has changed, it's the memory itself. We recreate it each time we try to "access" it.

Similarly with our identity. There is no past self so much as there's an overarching [narrative](/notes/narratives.md) that unifies past, present and future self. That single narrative can be rewritten which will change how we view our past, present and future self in the same action.
