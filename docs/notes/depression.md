# Depression

## Notes

Depression is when we feel [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md) and insecure about ourselves and the future, we lack [Self Worth](/notes/self-worth.md), we feel worthless and that it doesn't matter if we just disappear. Perhaps we feel [Indifference](/notes/indifference.md) towards the world, or that the world is indifferent towards us. It is the exact opposite of [Optimism](/notes/optimism.md), and depressed people are often [pessimistic](/notes/pessimism.md)

Depression often results in a [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md) because when we are depressed we tend to stop doing the things that can make us happy, like meeting with others [Happiness is shared](/notes/happiness-is-shared.md) [Human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md), sharing how we feel, and dedicating ourselves to a mission. We lack [Life's Mission](/notes/lifes-mission.md) and purpose in life. We close off our [Vulnerability](/notes/vulnerability.md) because we have been hurt too many times, despite the fact that being vulnerable, asking for help and sharing with others is what will help us escape this crisis.

What makes depression worse is when we start [comparing](/notes/comparisons.md) ourselves to others, we see others as the embodiment of perfection, which makes ourselves seem even worse in return.
