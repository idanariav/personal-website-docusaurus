# One-dimensional Being

## Notes

To be a one-dimensional being, is to oppose our [multitude](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), it means that we see ourselves as a single entity, fixed in [time](/notes/intertemporal-identity.md), unchanging and with a single will or sets of desires.
We believe that we are as we were [born](/notes/objectivity.md), staying the [same](/notes/fixed-mindset.md) until the day we die.

Usually, a one-dimensional being also believes that we are only capable of one thing. To be one thing, for example a specific professional career, a certain skill we can master, or even negative things such as the inability to deny certain addictions or faults since it is imbued within ourselves. It creates a certain degree of [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md), of being a victim, an observer to our lives rather than the one who has a say in it. We [infuse](/notes/cognitive-alignment.md) our identity with our actions and what happens to us. If we fail, then we are a failure, if we did something wrong, we are sinful. Our actions not only speak for our character, they are our identity.

Despite believing that we are one dimensional, we can't escape feeling different parts within ourselves. Unfortunately, we tend to treat them as hostile, as urges to be ignored or voices that we need to quiet down. We lack a feeling of an [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md).

We might even feel [alienated](/notes/alienation.md) from our own body. We think that there's a [Mind-Body Duality](/notes/mind-body-duality.md), that there's an "I" (that's us), and the "body" which we should control, since it doesn't represent our "true self".
According to this perception, free will is dominance, it is to have [Self-control](/notes/self-control.md), overpower the other forces within you with sheer willpower and determination.
