# Shallow Copy

## Notes

When we mistakenly believe that a mere copy is either a full representation of something else or even the thing itself. For example - a map is not the territory. It features some aspects of it, but not the full picture. During the creation of the map, some details are lost by necessity [Distillment](/notes/distillment.md).

A copy can never be "as real" as what it represents, because in terms of information, we can't distill something without aggregating or removing some of that information. Similarly, when creating a copy, it necessarily goes through the [subjective lens](/notes/subjective-reality.md) of the person who creates it. An architect, a bike driver, and a delivery person would all focus on something else when creating a map, leading to a partial, distorted representation of it.

It seems logical to say that every proxy is by definition a shallow copy of the "perfect" thing [Idealism](/notes/idealism.md)

Similarly, some people follow shallow copies as the meaning for their lives, like workoholics, without seeing how their choice is a shallow copy of the real thing [lost in the finite](/notes/lost-in-the-finite.md). Unfortunately these shallow copies are often more inviting than the real thing, because it focuses on the [image](/notes/form-vs-essence.md) rather than the core. For example - immersing yourself in a language is hard, but playing a language learning app is fun, even if it is less helpful.

However, sometimes we would want to purposefully use a shallow copy, because it is much easier to make and understand [relaxation](/notes/solve-the-easier-problem.md). Without google maps we would get lost, even if it is just partial information.
