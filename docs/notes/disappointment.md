# Disappointment

## Notes

Disappointment is when our [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) don't meet reality. The more we expect things of life, of others, especially things that are outside of our control [Acceptance](/notes/acceptance.md), the more we are likely to feel disappointment [Life is pain](/notes/life-is-pain.md).

Disappointment might also lead to [Regret](/notes/regret.md), thinking that in hindsight we should have acted differently.

Disappointment is the opposite of [forward thinking](/notes/forward-thinking.md), instead of looking ahead and thinking what we could do differently now, we focus on the past and how awful the current situation is.
