# Peer Support

## Notes

Peer support is the opposite of [Peer Pressure](/notes/social-environment.md) It is when we manage to have a team where ideas are not forced between members due to hierarchy and status, but rather ideas are shared, developed and improved. 

To have a successful peer support we need:
1. **Feedback** - people should be able to provide constructive feedback on each others ideas. The feedback should be aimed at the idea, not the person. to allow [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md) [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md). 
2. **Safety** - The members of the group have to feel like they can talk freely without negative repercussions [Psychological safety](/notes/psychological-safety.md), and they are even expected to be open and forthcoming about their thoughts [Honesty](/notes/honesty.md) 

The main benefit of the support group is a change in [Perspective](/notes/subjective-reality.md). When we include others in our thinking process, they could help us see past biases, especially the [Ownership Bias](/notes/attachment.md), and create a [Clean Slate](/notes/clean-slate.md). This benefit might even come from ourselves, because part of the process is to provide [Advice](/notes/advice.md), which we are more likely to listen to when we give it to someone else, so we might understand that it applies for us as well. 
Our peers can also help us keep ourselves [accountable](/notes/accountability.md) and help us maintain good habits.
