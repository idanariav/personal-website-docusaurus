# Social Contract

## Notes

Social Contract deals with the question of what ties us together as humans. This is not in the ethical sense but rather an analogy of on which conditions should people unite together and for which benefits. As we can see among popular philosophers, it is highly dependent on the "spirit" of the time, and on their perception of [Human Nature (MOC)](/mocs/human-nature-moc.md).

It is also revolves around the idea of [Consent](/notes/consent.md). Whether we as members of society would have consented to this kind of agreement, and whether newborns are considered as implicit consent to this agreement just by being born into this society. 

This theory of consent can sound rather Naive, and in most cases it is not like a person truly decides to join a society, but rather [coerced](/notes/soft-power.md) into feeling like a part of it.
