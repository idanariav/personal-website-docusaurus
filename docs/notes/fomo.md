# FOMO

## Notes

Fear of missing out is when we are [lost in the infinite](/notes/lost-in-the-infinite.md), we are unable to withstand the bombardment of choices and options in life, that we constantly feel [Stress](/notes/stress.md) and anxiety for the life that we don't live, at the price of ignoring or down playing the life that we do have. It is like the [shining new thing](/notes/shining-new-thing.md) syndrome, where we constantly distracted by the new, even if it is worse than the old [shallow copy](/notes/shallow-copy.md).

We can resist fomo is by having [Emotional Resilience](/notes/emotional-resilience.md). By being able to reflect on the feelings that arise without immediately responding to them [Surf the Urge](/notes/surf-the-urge.md), to evaluate them, and understand what it is about them that makes it so attractive, and whether it points to a real lack we have or a false one.

Another way is to consider the [Alternative cost](/notes/alternative-cost.md), by choosing to follow the fomo, what are we losing? What is the price that we pay, which activity we could no longer do because we are too busy on switching to a new one?
