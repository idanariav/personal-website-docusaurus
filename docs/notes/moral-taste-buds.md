# Moral Taste Buds

## Notes

Different societies (and people) have a lot of moral values in common, which means that a part of morality didn't develop through diffusion, but rather has always existed in us. The only difference between societies is that some societies value certain aspects more than others. So morality is more a question of which mix we make, i.e where we are on each scale, but not which different values altogether. It is rare that someone would be on the extreme end of a scale, and sometimes we stand on different locations based on the topic.

According to the book - We can identify six main moral axes:

1. **Care vs Harm** - originated from our need to care for the next generation. [Ethics of care](/notes/ethics-of-care.md)
2. **Fairness vs cheating** - originated from the benefit of cooperation. it's main goal is to achieve proportionality, that everyone gets what they deserve, based on their skills and inputs. [fairness](/notes/fairness.md)
3. **Loyalty vs Betrayal** - originated from the benefit of coalition building. [loyalty](/notes/loyalty.md)
4. **Authority vs subversion** - originated from the benefit of social norms and reduce conflict
5. **Sanctity vs degradation** - originated as social signals on what to avoid
6. **Liberty vs Oppression** - the desire to limit harm to your freedom, can be seen as equality of law, or having negative freedom. sometimes free riders can be seen as oppressors, and the main emotion is our desire to punish them, rather then creating a free society. [liberty](/notes/liberty.md)

However, I believe that the way he presents it is problematic. Each scale is made of one end which is obviously superior (who wants betrayal or harm?) and it misses the nuances of the other side. Also, I think that there are some points there are missing.
That's why I believe that there are 8 moral taste buds, which are:

1. **Sanctity vs Exploration** - To hold some unquestionable truths and taboos that must be kept, vs having few or no such truths, in an endless effort to adapt to "humanity's spirit" with modern intakes
2. **Equality vs Merits** - To share rights and resources with people just for their existence without any precondition, pure equality between all, vs people should be judged by their merit, which might entail different distribution of rights and resources, for example to be entitled to the fruits of your labor and creativity, as long as everyone has an equal chance of showing their worth.
3. **Individual vs Community** - The individual is the main or only source of value. He is the judge, jury and executioner of his own path to transcendence, and societal right is bestowed by him as long as it serves the individual. Vs the community is the main source of value, people, as social animals, are only a sub component of the community. Any individual right is bestowed by the community, as long as it serves it.
4. **Security vs Connectivity** - The main goal of society is to maintain the safety of its members above all else, treating others with suspicion and doubt, "walls", both physical and metaphorical are put in place to separate others and us. Vs strength and weakness are both sides of the same coin, and are gained by being connected to others, forming complex networksÂ  of dependence and cooperation.
5. **Destiny vs Cultivation** - Many things, if not all, in life are beyond our control, we should acknowledge that and learn to work within our given boundaries to prevent disappointment and failure. Vs our true potential is not only unknown, but also in our power to enlarge and shape, we are the makers of ourselves and our own density.
6. **Permissiveness vs Dedication** - Life is about being in the moment, finding experiencing which provide true enjoyment and happiness to oneself and perhaps others. We forgive our moments of weakness and understand that to be human is more than pure and relentless life of perfect morality. Vs we either are born with or make our own mission in the world, a purpose that drives us and demands us to spend time, effort and thought to fulfill it even at the price of personal happiness. To abandon the mission would be to fail who we are and what we stand for.
7. **Redemption vs Retribution** - Evil is something that either doesn't exist, or that can be fixed. People deserve a second chance, especially if their wrongdoing is caused by circumstances beyond their control. Vs true social peace is earned only when free riders are deterred by punishment, evil must be fought with and banished beyond existence.
8. **Authority vs Diversity** - Peace is achieved when all the parts know their place, and function together flawlessly thanks to rules and guidelines in place to ensure the stability of a top-down management. Vs strength comes from complexity, which is built on a diverse network of voices, sharing ideas and collaborating with hierarchy. Conflicts are solved by deliberation or popular vote.
