# Emotional Resilience

## Notes

The same way we can improve our body's immune system by eating healthy, being fit, and avoiding risky behavior, we can also improve our mental immune system and the way we process and handle emotions.

One main tool is [self talk](/notes/self-talk.md), which combines [Cognitive Distancing](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md) and[Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md) that will make it more likely that we will find better [Narratives](/notes/narratives.md) that will help us overcome [Challenge](/notes/struggle.md) and reach a healthy state of mind.

[Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md) is another example, a way to convert our emotions from negative to positive ones and give us strength.

Another method is to cultivate emotional diversity, which is the ability to experience and express a range of different emotions. In many senses it is like bio diversity, not only your life is richer, but also you have more emotional resilience, by being able to bounce back quicker from crisis.

Resilience is not about not experiencing emotions, but rather [Acknowledge](/notes/validation.md) them, to listen to them, to understand that they too convey important [information](/notes/emotions-as-decision-heuristics.md), yet to be able to withstand them and move on, to be hurt, to fall and get back up. This is true resilience.

When facing others, to avoid letting [External Influence](/notes/external-influence.md) get to you, you need to maintain your [Boundaries](/notes/boundaries.md), to keep your calm and treat others on your own term, rather than just reacting.
