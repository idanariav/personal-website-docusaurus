# Lifelong Learning

## Notes

Lifelong learning is the idea that learning is not something we do just once or twice, for example when we are kids in school, or later in college. Learning is something we have to do constantly throughout our lifetime, because:
1. **Growth** - if you want to maintain a [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md), you have to keep on learning, sharpening your mind and discovering new ideas
2. **Stopping is failing** - Due to the increased [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md) of human knowledge, if we stay still that probably means that we're going to [fall](/notes/competitive-advantage.md) behind, for example our knowledge could become outdated, our job could be replaced by AI, etc...

Having a lifelong learning mindset, we need to:
1. **Be a beginner** - After we have gained some knowledge, it is easy to fall for the [Dunning-kruger effect](/notes/dunning-kruger-effect.md), thinking that we are experts in the field and that there's nothing more to learn. To avoid it, we need to always see ourselves as a student, always open for learning something new, as if our mind is blank [Beginner's Mind](/notes/beginners-mind.md).
2. **Relearn what we know** - Knowledge doesn't stay in our heads forever, what we have learned we will also [Forget](/notes/forgetfulness.md). That's why we have to include a [spaced repetition](/notes/spaced-repetition.md) method as part of our learning process, and acknowledge that if we won't learn consistently, whichever knowledge we gained will be forgotten.
3. **Be consistent** - knowledge is a marathon, not a sprint. As long as we are able to have a learning habit, as long as we are learning [consistently](/notes/consistency.md), we will have much greater [Competence](/notes/competence.md) than those who do an intense learning session and then quit [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md)
