# Multitasking Doesn't Exist

## Notes

Multitasking doesn't exist because at any single moment, we can only [focus](/notes/focus.md) on a single thing. So at best, multitasking is a quickly [switching](/notes/task-switching.md) between tasks, and the dream of actually doing things simultaneously is unfortunately a myth. The only exception is in cases where one of those actions don't require focus at all, for example I can walk and talk at the same time, or wash dishes and listen to a podcast.

Furthermore, Our [Executive Attention Network](/notes/executive-attention-network.md) is best utilized when we have only a single thing in our attention span, because uncompleted task still take space in our mind, limiting the available [resources](/notes/working-memory.md) for focusing on the task at hand [Attention Residue](/notes/attention-residue.md).

Multitasking is also a main cause for [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md), by trying to overload ourselves with tasks, while falsely thinking that "I can do it all" causes to experience high levels of [Stress](/notes/stress.md) when we eventually fail to manage these tasks effectively.

The key is [less is more](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md), by realizing that we can't be everywhere all at once, that our time and energy are [scarce](/notes/scarcity.md) resources, we realize that we should be [Saying no](/notes/saying-no.md) more often.
