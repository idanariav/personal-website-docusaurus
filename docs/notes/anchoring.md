# Anchoring

## Notes

Anchoring is a method by which we reduce Ambiguity by setting a concrete value for comparison in a given topic. Since it makes it easier for comparison, by the way of least resistance we are "forced" to use this value as our frame of reference even if it is far from the actual value.
For example, asking you whether Uganda has a population of higher or lower than 1 million would make you give a lower estimate in comparison with if I had asked about higher or lower than 10 million.
Therefore, anchoring is way to affect the Subjective Reality in others.
