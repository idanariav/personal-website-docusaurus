# Social Environment

## Notes

Our social environment dictates our norms and behavior through explicit and implicit [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md). It is in our human nature that we want to [belong](/notes/inclusion.md), and not just for the sake of enjoyment, our very identity, values, beliefs and norms are shaped through our interaction with others. [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md)

The problem arises when we become [passive](/notes/helplessness.md) in the process and turn this into a one-sided thing where we fall to conformism without being true to our inner self [Authenticity](/notes/authenticity.md) [Integrity](/notes/integrity.md). We [default](/notes/defaults.md) to go with the will of the masses without question. Usually because we either fear social exclusion or perhaps that assume that others have vital information that we don't.

On a large scale, this leads to herd Mentality. when we are perhaps too influenced by [external forces](/notes/external-influence.md) such that we are not capable of independent thought. We have embraced completely our [Objectivity](/notes/objectivity.md) and became a pawn in someone or something else's world view.
Usually this is accompanied by being a member of an organization, religion, political movement etc.

Collective or group thinking is when we prioritize getting to a consensus on a given topic rather than exploring different viewpoints or ways of thinking [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md). This doesn't have to be conscious, members of a group can feel pressure, real or imaginary, to have the same opinion as the group, in a self-inflicted way. [Psychological safety](/notes/psychological-safety.md) This not only changes their expressed opinion, but also their actual beliefs [Soft power](/notes/soft-power.md).
Usually social hierarchy determines which opinion becomes the accepted one.
