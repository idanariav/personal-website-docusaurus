# Second order Thinking

## Notes

Second order thinking is a type of meta-thinking, which often happens during the process of [introspection](/notes/introspection.md). We examine our preferences, our values, and our thoughts. For example, a first order thinking would be "I want to eat chocolate right now". A second order thinking would be "do I want to be a person who eats chocolate?". Like a smoker who feels an urge to smoke, and in general wants to quit smoking. When your first and second order thinking are not aligned it's a sign of [intrapersonal conflict](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md), and when they are aligned we can say that we have the [ability](/notes/agency.md) to follow through with our [authentic](/notes/authenticity.md) self.
