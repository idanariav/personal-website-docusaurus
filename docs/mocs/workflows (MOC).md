# Workflows

## Notes

Workflows are ways to improve the efficiency of our effort without increasing it, meaning to get a better return for the same investments.

### Concepts
1. [[Planning]] - Before rushing in to a task, first plan what you are going to do, what you are trying to achieve, and how.
2. [[Pre-Mortem]] - By thinking in advance what can go wrong, we are more likely to avoid those situations, or to be ready for them when they arrive
3. [[Pareto Principle]] - Everything is made up of the 20% the provides 80% of the benefits. Focus on those 20% and try to increase their share while reducing the 80%
4. [[Multitrack]] - Don't put all you eggs in one basket, work on several ideas simultaneously to have option b while also allowing yourself to enrich ideas back and forth between the options.
5. [[Deadline Effect]] - Have a deadline for your tasks otherwise they will take forever to complete. Make a promise to yourself and others.
6. [[Multiplier]] - The essence of productivity. Stop and review your workflows once in a while and see which tools, mental models or processes can have a multiplier effect on your work.
7. [[Trust the Process]] - Don't measure your results on a daily level or be obsessed about your goals, some things take time. Just focus on doing the right things each day, and the results will come on their own.
8. [[Life's Mission]] - Don't forget your why. Remember why you are doing what you are doing, how it connects to your values and identity.
9. [[Contextual synergy|Timing]] - To do things in the right moment they should be done, not before or after.
