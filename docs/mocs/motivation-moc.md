# Motivation (MOC)

## Notes

### what sparks our motivation
Several things are good for our motivation:
1. [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md) - a feeling of constant movement. Once we get the ball rolling, it is much easier to continue rather than to stop
2. [Gamification](/notes/gamification.md) - why not make it fun? When a boring task becomes fun, we are much more motivated to do it
3. [Intrinsic Motivation](/notes/intrinsic-motivation.md) - when we are deeply connected to a subject, that we want to pursue it for it's own sake 
4. [Life's Mission](/notes/lifes-mission.md) - when what we do is connected to who we wish to be, to our goal in life
5. [Role Models](/notes/role-models.md) - when we have someone that we look up to and we want to follow their footsteps
6. [Inspiration](/notes/inspiration.md) - when we get inspired by something, a feeling of awe, a sense of resonating within us

### what takes it away

When we lack motivation we experience [Burnout](/notes/burnout.md), when we feel depleted without any energy left to continue on going. Some common contributors to burnout are:
1. [External Motivation](/notes/external-motivation.md) - when we rely on external rewards as the source for our motivation, it can quickly turn into a negative spiral because we focus more on the rewards than on the task itself, and once the rewards stop or become irrelevant, we lose the will to continue with the task. our [Incentives](/notes/incentives.md) turn from inwards facing to outwards.
