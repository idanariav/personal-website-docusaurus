# Metaphysics (MOC)

## Notes

How do we know what exists? what is the nature of our reality? These are the types of questions that belong to the metaphysics. Specifically it deals with things that we are not sure how much they exist in the physical world or not.

For example, [Panpsychism](/notes/panpsychism.md) believes that consciousness is a property of even the smallest of objects. [Idealism](/notes/idealism.md) suggests that everything that exists in the physical world is a distorted copy of a perfect representation in the "world of forms". [Objectivism](/notes/objectivism.md) deals with whether we are even capable of grasping the reality "as it as", or are we forced o see only a distorted view based on our pre-existing perspective.
