# Human Nature

## Notes
Are people inherently good? What are our default modes of thought and action?
What is our true human nature? It is hard to separate the effects of [nature vs nurture](/notes/nature-vs-nurture.md)

It is believed that:
1. [A person is a community](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md) - we contain multitude within us, we are never just "one thing", especially not across time.
2. [humans are good as default](/notes/humans-are-good-as-default.md) - we seek the happiness of ourselves and others. The desire to harm others is a taught constraint to that goal.
3. [sense seeking creatures](/notes/sense-seeking-creatures.md) - we seek meaning for our lives, explanations for things that happen to us
4. [Communication is in our nature](/notes/communication-is-in-our-nature.md) - we were built to communicate with others and share our thoughts, beliefs, perspectives.
5. human [Human is a social being](/notes/human-is-a-social-being.md) - we were born to be a part of a community, to have relationships with others.

How we think:
1. [Risk Management](/notes/risk-management.md) - we tend to be loss averse as default
2. [Extended Mind](/notes/extended-mind.md) - we tend to think through our interaction with the environment, specifically while using our bodies (walking, talking with the hands). Thinking is not isolated in the brain
3. [Storytelling](/notes/storytelling.md) - we convey information better through stories
4. [Utility](/notes/utility.md) - we can often see the world through mathematical lenses, trying to quantify the benefit from doing an action or receiving an item.
5. [Death](/notes/death.md) - like it or not, death is a constant thought in our mind, and it dictates in one way or another our perception of reality and how we choose to dedicate our time and attention.

our social nature:
1. [Social Environment](/notes/social-environment.md) - we are highly affected by the social environment we are in, the expectations of others, social pressure and culture norms are a good predictor of our own behavior
2. [Social Contract](/notes/social-contract.md) - How do we form as societies? the theory of social contract suggests some answers to that.
