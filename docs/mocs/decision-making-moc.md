# Decision Making

## Notes

Making a decision is not easy. Most often we stick to the [Defaults](/notes/defaults.md) without even knowing it, and fail to ask ourselves [When to Quit](/notes/when-to-quit.md) . Even when we feel like we are in charge, we use simple and sometimes biases [Heuristics](/notes/heuristics.md) and default to [Binary Thinking](/notes/binary-thinking.md)

While using [Nudge](/notes/nudge.md) can solve most of our problems in terms of large scale policies, it is still not enough on the individual level. We need to:
1. [win win situations](/notes/win-win-situations.md) - Look for win win situations instead of a zero-sum game
2. [intentionality](/notes/intentionality.md) - we need to be mindful of our decisions and notice the defaults and other forces that are in play
3. [Alternative cost](/notes/alternative-cost.md) - what are you missing out by choosing this option?
4. [exploration vs exploitation](/notes/exploration-vs-exploitation.md) - when do you convert from investing in setting it up to enjoying the fruits of your labor?
5. [Ripple effect](/notes/ripple-effect.md) - which decision you can make that will ripple out to others to create a better environment overall?
