# organizational knowledge management

## Notes

### What are the negative impacts of no knowledge management
1. **Knowledge Silos** -  Workers leaving, taking critical knowledge with them
2. **Worker Initiation** - A long, costly process of bringing new workers up to speed
3. **Knowledge misalignment** - Workers operating under different assumptions as to what company metrics mean / how they are defined
4. **Errors / low quality products** - Mistakes are repeated, lessons unimplemented, which results in creating lower quality outputs or crises that could have been avoided
5. **Reinventing the wheel** - Redeveloping existing features/tools or working on a problem that has already been solved/doesn’t exist anymore.**
### How can knowledge management help us?
1. 

### OKM components

#### The system
okm is more than just a tool, it's a mindset, it's a process. The core aspects are:

##### Developing
1. **culture and habits** - Routines for capturing and using knowledge
2. **templates and automation** - tools for simplifying the process, while also increasing information quality
3. **workflows** - Clear plan for when and how information should be documented, reviewed, and discarded. 
4. **shared language** - Improve clarity by aligning terminology between teams 
5. **clear structure** - A flexible yet stable structure where information is kept

##### Deploying
1. incorporating into a weekly routine
2. **pilots** - Do many, small experiments that will provide quick feedback
3. **leadership** - by example, encouragement
4. **clear expectations** - do's and don'ts, how, what, when.

##### Evaluating
1. **sampling** - reviewing sample documents and measuring their quality/relevance
2. **tracking KPIs** - Reviewing knowledge management dashboards
3. **feedback** - Use surveys and interviews to collect feedback (both on the system implementation and the current pain points and bottlenecks)

And repeat. This process is lead and managed by team leads, and dedicated okm consultants

#### The organization

##### The tool(s)
Often knowledge travels in more than a single tool, including email, messages, meeting recordings, external files, and duplicate documentation systems. and companies have little flexibility (especially short term) with which tools they are using, unless it's a small organization that just beginning. 
1. **Map the tools used** - Which information travels where, remember that information is not just written text. 
2. **Strength and weaknesses** - Since low friction is key, the system must adapt accordingly. It should be clear what is the optimal purpose of each tool. Trying to "do it all" within a single tool is as bad as getting lost between several tools. 
3. **Connect and simplify** -  Automation and integrations are key to reducing friction and the flow of knowledge between tools


##### Organizational structure
1. Which teams are usually the source of information (by area of expertise)
2. Does information flow both ways or one way?
3. Does information flow vertically and/or horizontally?
4. Are there systems of collaboration in place?


##### The culture

###### Information consumption habits
1. needs and problems - Which issues tend to arise repeatably
2. one-stop shop - Do workers have a place that they can trust to find valuable information?
3. perspective and preferences - What is the preferred method of information consumption?

###### Information capturing habits
1. low friction - Make it easy
2. freedom to explore - Provide chances for exploration, which can add valuable knowledge to the organization
3. incubation space - Information quality is a gradual process. A too-high threshold would make note generation impossible. 

###### Knowledge - output integration
1. How can better knowledge support the company goals?
2. What are the main pain points today with the existing knowledge infrastructure

###### Sharing culture
1. Are there mechanisms in place for sharing information across/within teams? 
2. Which norms govern the interaction between/within teams? For example "we all work together" vs "every person for themselves"

#### The information

##### Quality
1. **clarity** - It is easy to understand what the note is about and what it tries to convey. It contains only relevant information
2. **usability** - The information is actionable, it "matters", it is "useful".
3. **searchable** - It is easy to locate. We know where it is, and how to find it.
4. **resurfacing** - Without searching for this note specifically, it appears where it will likely be needed

##### Metadata
1. **shelf life** - Is the company knowledge long-lasting or quickly outdated and replaced?
2. **medium** - What is the most common medium of information? Written text, recordings, pictures, presentations...
3. **context** - common fields such as who wrote it, when, last updated, review status

##### Type
1. **atomic note** - A short note describing a single idea
2. **synthesis** - A comprehensive note that describes a complex idea/system, combining knowledge from multiple sources, or different types of same information (for example the business side and technical side of a feature)
3. **map of content** - An overview of a topic, usually a more top-down approach
