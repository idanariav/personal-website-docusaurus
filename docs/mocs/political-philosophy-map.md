# Political Philosophy (Map)

## Notes

Political philosophy deals with questions related to how we interact as people within a society, which forces govern us, how do we come to agreement (or not) as people, and which topics interest us as a society the most.

### What is a state
1. [Social Contract](/notes/social-contract.md) - A result of a implicit or explicit consent of groups of people that decide to live together under a joint rule. 
2. [Neutrality](/notes/neutrality.md) - We imagine the state as something neutral, that represents all the different sides of society, while it is much easier said than done, can different voices really be merged into one? ([Pluralism](/notes/pluralism.md) )
3. [Justice](/notes/justice.md) - we believe that a society has to be just, that it treats it's members equally and works to the benefit of their wellbeing. 
### Threats to social cohesion
1. [Inequality](/notes/inequality.md) - inequality breeds conflicts and dissatisfaction within a society. IT is not only the differences in resources, but rather the differences in power that are of interest, and their effect on how we perceive reality ([Soft power](/notes/soft-power.md)) 
2. [Commodification](/notes/commodification.md) - when economical view penetrates areas that are meant to be sacred
3. Segregation - when we treat others as not equal in terms of rights, and even not as worthy of being called human ([Moral worth](/notes/moral-worth.md) )
4. security - What are the limitations on individuals that we are willing to accept for the security of the society.

### How to increase social cohesion
1. [Diversity](/notes/diversity.md) - promote the inclusion and fusion of different voices in the public sphere. This is not always so easy to implement ([Affirmative Action (podcast)](/notes/affirmative-action-podcast.md) )

### Ideologies
1. post-modernism - we were influenced by grand narratives that have narrowed our ways of thinking and reduced it to a herd mentality ([Post-Modernism](/notes/post-modernism.md) )
2. vail of ignorance - the only way to create a just society is to try and remove ourselves from the equation, to think as if we make decisions behind a vail of ignorance ([Veil of ignorance](/notes/veil-of-ignorance.md) )
3. Functionalism - to see that each part of society plays a role, and society is the mergent property of the combination of those different roles. ([Functionalism](/notes/functionalism.md) )
