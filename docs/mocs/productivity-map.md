# Productivity (Map)

## Notes

There are a variety of ways/methods/systems for us to handle, focus and preform what we need to do. It is likely that the variety exists since we as people have different tastes and ways to motivate ourselves. however I believe that some core principles still apply for most people.

The basic division of productivity is into:
1. **Time management** - how do we choose to use our time, what gets priority, how do we make time to what's important [Time Management (Map)](/mocs/time-management-map.md)
2. **Resource management** - how do we use the space, our tools, to our advantage [Resource management (Map)](/mocs/resource-management-map.md)
3. **Workflows** - methods of execution, how to perform tasks quickly and efficiently. [workflows (Map)](/mocs/workflows-map.md)
