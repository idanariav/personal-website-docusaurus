Team leading ideas:  
1. 10% free time for side/passion projects  
2. Two deep work blocks (morning+afternoon) of 1.5 hours  
3. Daily: sharing problems/setbacks, requests for help, tips+tricks.  
4. Weekly 1v1 for personal goals and issues  
5. Weekly team meeting for sharing side projects, important announcements, team deep dives, etc  
6. Daily half hour for "cleanup" - update documentation  
7. Maps of content for important subjects  
8. Different checklist per project type, simple- no documentation. Medium - documentation, complex - 2 team members, pre murtum

10. Radical transparency  
11. Work-life balance, set boundaries and urgency metrics
