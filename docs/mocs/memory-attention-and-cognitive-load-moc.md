# Memory, Attention and Cognitive Load (MOC)

## Notes

Our brain has only a limited capacity for [Working Memory](/notes/working-memory.md), that means it's easy for us to forget or be distracted unless we know how to best utilize the way our brain works.

Note that memory, or thinking in general is not only located in the brain ([Extended Mind](/notes/extended-mind.md) ). and can be distorted by post-hoc rationalization

Methods for improving our memory:
1. [Effort Storing](/notes/effort-storing.md) - Instead of hoping to remember in the future what we know now, why not commit that to a plan/writing, such that later on it will be much easier to bring back the memory
2. [Mental Shortcuts](/notes/mental-shortcuts.md) - Use analogies or other forms of representations and cues to tag the information and search it in an easier way later on. (also see [Cue based memorization](/notes/cue-based-memorization.md) )
3. [Memory Palace](/notes/memory-palace.md) - Use your spatial pathfinding to make memories more concrete, as if you are building a library in your brain
4. [Blank Space](/notes/blank-space.md) - Every organization system needs an empty space to be used as an inbox to process incoming information
