# Success (Map)

## Notes


### Success is an internal state
True, fulfilling success is not dependent on the external world, such as the amount of money you have, or whether or not you have completed a challenge. Success is an internal, continuous state. It is how well you are satisfied with your life, with yourself and your actions. [Happiness is an internal state](/notes/happiness-is-an-internal-state.md)

### Success is not the opposite of failure
you are successful when you learn from your mistakes [Failure](/notes/failure.md) [Lifelong Learning](/notes/lifelong-learning.md)

### Success is an act of doing, not being
Success is not related to how famous you are, rather if you have contributed or not. Success is expressed by improving others' lives using your knowledge and skills. Whether they acknowledge you or not for it is irrelevant. [to be moral is to act moral](/notes/to-be-moral-is-to-act-moral.md)
