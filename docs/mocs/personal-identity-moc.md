# Personal Identity (MOC)

## Notes

What does it mean to have a personal identity?
what is it made of? is it constant across time?

### personal identity is not personal at all
We are hardly just a single person, not in the current moment, and especially not across time.

we are a collection of beings -  [A person is a community](/notes/a-person-is-a-community.md)
that is shaped by and shapes others - [Interpersonal Identity](/notes/interpersonal-identity.md),
and it is not fixed in time [Intertemporal Identity](/notes/intertemporal-identity.md)

### personal identity and change

Not only that our identity shapes our thinking - [change starts from the inside out](/notes/change-starts-from-the-inside-out.md)
but it also works the other way around - [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md),
our thinking has the ability to allow us to grow and develop our identity [What we do is not who we are](/notes/cognitive-distancing.md), and to guide us towards the right things [Love what is good](/notes/love-what-is-good.md),
but also to hold us back [Fixed Mindset](/notes/fixed-mindset.md) and become a [one-dimensional being](/notes/one-dimensional-being.md)
Personal change is not linear, at least not changes in our core identity. Those changes occur in single moments of [Identity Discovery](/notes/identity-discovery.md), where our sense of self is challenged and we need to create a new one.
### how to treat yourself

you have the ability to choose how to treat yourself.
you can either decide to seek control over yourselves - [will to power](/notes/will-to-power.md)
or seek harmony between your different selves [harmonious self](/notes/harmonious-self.md), to combine emotion and reason [Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md), and to be kind [Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md).
