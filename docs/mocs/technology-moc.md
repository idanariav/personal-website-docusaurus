# Technology (MOC)

## Notes

My technology knowledge is divided between two main pillars. The first is focused around [Data Analysis (MOC)](/mocs/data-analysis-moc.md) or [Data Science (MOC)](/mocs/data-science-moc.md), such as tableau, python etc...
and the second is focused around tools that help me in my [PKM (MOC)](/mocs/pkm-moc.md) or [Productivity (MOC)](/mocs/productivity-moc.md), such as obsidian, JavaScript, etc...

I find that technology is also a inseparable part of my [Learning (MOC)](/mocs/learning-moc.md) habits, since I use tools such as Udemy, Duolingo, and other apps to learn, and document it all in obsidian.

### Programming Languages

#### [Python (MOC)](/mocs/python-moc.md)

i have done (or about to do several courses in python)
[Python + SQL + Tableau (course)](/notes/python-+-sql-+-tableau-course.md)
[Python for data science (course)](/notes/python-for-data-science-course.md) - this is the best course for data science/analysis, teaches useful packages such as NumPy, pandas, seaborn, etc...
also did a deep dive on python classes, since it is the backbone of OOP
[Python classes](/notes/python-classes.md)
[Complete python scripting for automation (course)](/notes/complete-python-scripting-for-automation-course.md) - gives a shallow completing information on working with files, systems and environments (things that data analysis courses don't cover)
[Automation with Python (course)](/notes/automation-with-python-course.md)

#### [SQL (MOC)](/mocs/sql-moc.md)

[Microsoft SQL 70-461 (course)](/notes/microsoft-sql-70-461-course.md) - definitely the best course I have done, teaches really in depth about it
[The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022 (course)](/notes/the-complete-sql-bootcamp-2022-course.md)
[SQL - MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intell (course)](/notes/sql---mysql-for-data-analytics-and-business-intell-course.md)

#### [JavaScript (MOC)](/mocs/javascript-moc.md)

the engine behind obsidian, which enables me to run all my custom scripts and understand what is happening beneath the hood.
[The Complete JavaScript Course 2022 From Zero to Expert (course)](/notes/the-complete-javascript-course-2022-from-zero-to-expert-course.md)


#### general concepts

[how to write testable code](/notes/how-to-write-testable-code.md)
[Interpretation vs compilation](/notes/interpretation-vs-compilation.md)


### Tools and services


Mermaid is a really useful tool for creating flow charts within markdown, although I think that excalidraw is more useful

[excalibrain](/notes/excalibrain.md) - a tool to navigate between notes in obsidian, better than the graph view in terms of usability and seeing connections

#### [Power BI (MOC)](/mocs/power-bi-moc.md)
[Power BI (course)](/notes/power-bi-course.md) - a great visualization tool.

#### [Tableau (MOC)](/mocs/tableau-moc.md)
[Building interactive dashboards with Tableau (course)](/notes/building-interactive-dashboards-with-tableau-course.md) - a strong candidate for a visualization tool

#### [Obsidian (MOC)](/mocs/obsidian-moc.md)
a useful list of plugins, keyboard shortcuts, and general comments

### Misc.
