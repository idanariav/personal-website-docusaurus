# Personal Identity (MOC)

## Notes

What does it mean to have a personal identity?
what is it made of? is it constant across time?

### personal identity is not personal at all
We are hardly just a single person, not in the current moment, and especially not across time.

we are a collection of beings -  [[A person is a community]]
that is shaped by and shapes others - [[Interpersonal Identity]],
and it is not fixed in time [[Intertemporal Identity]]

### personal identity and change

Not only that our identity shapes our thinking - [[change starts from the inside out]]
but it also works the other way around - [[Growth Mindset]],
our thinking has the ability to allow us to grow and develop our identity [[Cognitive Distancing|What we do is not who we are]], and to guide us towards the right things [[Love what is good]],
but also to hold us back [[Fixed Mindset]] and become a [[one-dimensional being]]
Personal change is not linear, at least not changes in our core identity. Those changes occur in single moments of [[Identity Discovery]], where our sense of self is challenged and we need to create a new one.
### how to treat yourself

you have the ability to choose how to treat yourself.
you can either decide to seek control over yourselves - [[will to power]]
or seek harmony between your different selves [[harmonious self]], to combine emotion and reason [[Emotional Aikido]], and to be kind [[Self-compassion]].
