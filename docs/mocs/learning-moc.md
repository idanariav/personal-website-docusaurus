# Learning (MOC)

## Notes

### Learning habits and routines
[The 5 Hour Rule](/notes/the-5-hour-rule.md)
[Lifelong Learning](/notes/lifelong-learning.md)
### General techniques

Learning is a collection of steps and techniques we can take to improve the chances of retaining the knowledge we acquired, and to improve the quality of our outputs based on that knowledge.

These are the main steps:
#### 1. Planning
First, to learn something requires us to understand what to learn.
Research on what constitutes the subject you wish to learn. How and what do others
study? what is important to focus on? How can you test your progress and implement what you've learned?

Define yourself a clear goal, and a roadmap on how to reach that goal.
Think about which resources you can use, and be aware of the [learning by doing](/notes/learning-by-doing.md) chart.

#### 2. Chunking
once you figured out what you want to learn. Divide in into chunks using [Chunking](/notes/chunking.md).
[distill](/notes/distillment.md) as much as you can the skills and procedures you are trying to learn and separate them into different practices that you can improve on individually.

#### 3. Challenge

once you have a clear, atomized unit of learning, you need to create a challenge for yourself.
A too easy lesson won't push you forward, while a too hard lesson will hurt your motivation and you will still lack the tools to extract valuable input from that lesson.

Therefore you need a goldilocks challenge, not too easy, not too hard. Always right next to your upper limit. And remember that [learning should be hard](/notes/learning-should-be-hard.md).

#### 3. Focus

Learning is one of the most active activities you can do. Without [Focus](/notes/focus.md) you will not be able to progress with your learning. A challenging lesson that you do without paying attention is worthless. 

#### 4. feedback

An important measure of a useful lesson is the type of [Feedback](/notes/feedback.md) you get from it. Good feedback will point you into the right direction on how to improve next time.
The last three components together form the basic structure of a [Deliberate Practice](/notes/deliberate-practice.md).

#### 5. repetition

Don't think that one lesson per topic is enough. We humans constantly forget and require reinforcing our knowledge in order to prevent it from disappearing. Acknowledge that learning is an act of repetition and that learning is adding new layers rather than replacing old ones[Layering](/notes/layering.md).
Therefore a key component is to include [spaced repetition](/notes/spaced-repetition.md).


#### 6. Implementation

Theoretical knowledge alone is not only a lesser form of knowledge, but it is also useless on it's own. You need to test out your knowledge in order to really make it stick, and this will provide you with further feedback for improvement. For example, just learning how to read notes is not enough to know how to play, or learning how to conjugate a verb is nice but it's not the same as speaking a language.
It would be helpful to consider [Contextual synergy](/notes/contextual-synergy.md), meaning to use the context for your benefit. For example, to learn a language while you are traveling abroad.

Test out your knowledge in real life situations, and remember that [practice beats perfection](/notes/practice-beats-perfection.md). You don't have to wait until you are a true expert in order to test yourself. It is harmful for your progress in more ways than one.

#### 7. experimentation

Learning means that we accept that there is something that we don't know. And that is true not only about the field we are trying to study, but also on how we interact with it. We need to change our learning methods once in a while to see what works, and once we are familiar with the topic, to experiment there as well. This is a true mark of progress once you know that you can use what you've learned in new situations, essentially [Transferred Learning](/notes/transferred-learning.md).

#### 8. Pass it on
[Mastery](/notes/mastery.md) is only achieved once we feel comfortable enough with our knowledge that we can teach someone else. 
A popular technique is the [Feynman Technique](/notes/feynman-technique.md)
