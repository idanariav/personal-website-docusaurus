# Emotions (MOC)

## Notes

"Negative" emotions is sometimes useful sometimes misleading definition.
In essence, it is all the emotions that we feel as unpleasant, that we wish we wouldn't have felt, and that might be more harmful than beneficial if used incorrectly.

For example:
1. [Anger](/notes/anger.md) - A powerful tool for motivation yet a very destructive power. One that can consume relationships and our internal wellbeing
2. [Boredom](/notes/boredom.md) - Often a sign that we are wasting our time. Either we are doing something unimportant unchallenging. Instead of trying to replace that filling with empty distractions, we should answer the root cause of this behavior
3. [Depression](/notes/depression.md) - A deep hole that is very hard to crawl out of. Unfortunately, sometimes the only way out is through, and by yourself. Others are a necessary support, our lifeline, but it is up to us to pull ourselves out of this crisis, to face our fears and answer our questions. 
4. [Fear](/notes/fear.md) - When we encounter threats and challenges that we believe are too much to take (for now). Do we let them rule our lives or do we face them head on?
5. [Helplessness](/notes/helplessness.md) - when we don't recognize our power to do something to improve or get out of a bad situation
6. [Guilt](/notes/guilt.md) - a signal that we have done something we are not proud of, a reparation that needs to be made.
7. [Regret](/notes/regret.md) - a signal that we could have acted better, and perhaps now know how to improve ourselves
8. [Loneliness](/notes/loneliness.md) - one of the most deadliest diseases of man. Whether we are alone is usually not the important question, what matter's is that we feel alone, and we should reach out to others
9. [Rejection](/notes/rejection.md) - when we treat cases of bad matching as a proof we are worthless, although we should see it as is, that a better match is somewhere out there for us to find.
10. [Stress](/notes/stress.md) - one of the most common feelings out there, when we feel that we don't do enough, when we are not enough, Stress can also be a focusing feeling in small doses. 

The common trait across all those feelings is that instead of letting them control us ([Emotional hijacking](/notes/emotional-hijacking.md)), we need to learn from them, to listen, to embrace, and reach a resolution. To treat emotions as consulters, as sensors and nothing more, and use them as fuel to act the way we truly wish to act ([Emotional Aikido](/notes/emotional-aikido.md))
