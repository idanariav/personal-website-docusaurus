# Habits

## Notes

Habits are all about creating routines that are easy to maintain, that generates [Momentum](/notes/momentum.md) and have a [Compounding](/notes/compounding.md) effect on our lives. When we have good habits in place, we can [Trust the Process](/notes/trust-the-process.md) to lead us to our goals while focusing only on the next step/iteration.

### How Habit Forms
1. [The habit loop](/notes/the-habit-loop.md) - Habits form a cycle of cue-behavior-reward
2. [Genetic Switches](/notes/genetic-switches.md) - Habits can affect our DNA by switching certain genes on or off (and even carry to our children)
