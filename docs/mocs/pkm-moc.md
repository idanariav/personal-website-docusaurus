# PKM (MOC)

## Notes

A pkm system is a collection of tools, methods and way of thinking that together forms a system that helps you remember, act and process ideas, thoughts and plans.

The basic idea behind this is that [our mind is a processor and not a warehouse](/notes/our-mind-is-a-processor-and-not-a-warehouse.md), using digital tools can have a huge benefit on our productivity and well-being if we use the best of both worlds. Digital tools to store information, and our brain to process and enrich it.

A pkm system can several uses:
1. **Project management** - could be Todo lists but also content writing, planning a vacation, work projects, etc. This also includes a sub section of goal setting.
2. **Knowledge management** - a way to collect, connect and get insights from notes, thoughts, ideas from others.
3. **Journaling** - periodical reviews, gratitude journal.
4. **Archive** - storing important information (more like a file management system, keeping documents, instructions, details on events...)

People vary in which of the four uses they implement in a pkm system. Note these uses don't have to be used within the same system. Although usually combining everything into a single system provides [Emergence](/notes/emergence.md).

### Knowledge management
A common workflow for knowledge management is usually:
1. **Capture** - a method to collect external information into your system, based on your interests and goals. [Capture content](/notes/capture-content.md)
2. **Organize** - take the newly collect information that you captured, and connect it to your system, add metadata or put it in a place that will provide the right context.

3. **Distill** - extract the valuable information, process it, connect to other ideas. [Note taking (MOC)](/mocs/note-taking-moc.md)

As mentioned, one of the more powerful features of such a system is that it can easily resurface important ideas once they have been properly processed. However there are methods to make it easier as well. 

### Attributes of knowledge
1. [Clarity](/notes/clarity.md) - to make something understandable
2. [Simplicity](/notes/simplicity.md) - To make something easy to follow
3. [Atomism](/notes/atomism.md) - To find the smallest core of an idea
4. [Complexity](/notes/complexity.md) - When the amount of information is just too much for one person to handle
5. [Emergence](/notes/emergence.md) - The unit is greater than the sum of it's parts
6. [Medium Independent](/notes/medium-independent.md) - Information is shapeless, it can be transmitted through various mediums. 

### Organizational knowledge management
1. Retention - maintaining knowledge of employees who retire  
2. Initiation - transferring knowledge to new employees  
3. Tacit vs explicit - experts who forget to mention what they already see as obvious
