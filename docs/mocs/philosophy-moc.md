# Philosophy (MOC)

## Notes
Philosophy can be broken down a few areas of focus:

### Ethics
[Ethics (MOC)](/mocs/ethics-moc.md) is the study of aligning thoughts in actions in a way that is compatible with a certain truth, whether internal or external, which is suppose to be beneficial either to the actor or other beings or objects out there in the world.
If for example we ask ourselves whether we should donate to the poor, or whether we should switch the tracks in the trolly problem, its a question of ethics.

### Metaphysics
[Metaphysics (MOC)](/mocs/metaphysics-moc.md) deals with questions of reality, what exists and how it came into existence, what are it's attributes, and the methods of understanding these topics. Nowadays it is perhaps better named as philosophy of science. Questions like "is the soul real", "is there a world out there or is it a figment of our imagination", "which properties/truths if any can we know for sure or is everything subjective and depends on misguided sense", belong to the field of Metaphysics.

### Epistemology

[Epistemology (MOC)](/mocs/epistemology-moc.md) deals with questions on how do we know what we know/believe in, what does it mean "to know" something, is there more than one type of knowledge, for example to know a fact compared to knowing how to ride a bike, how is knowledge formed on the societal level, these are topics of epistemology.

### Existentialism

[Existentialism (MOC)](/mocs/existentialism-moc.md) deals with the "small" topic of the meaning of life, whether it is prescribed/predestined or created, do we find or create our meaning in life. Which forces lead us as intelligent beings, what is our primary purpose. Of course the answer to these questions will have ethical consequences, but they precede them.

### Philosophy of Language

[Philosophy of Language (MOC)](/mocs/philosophy-of-language-moc.md) deals with language, how it came into being, is it simply a tool we use, or the glasses by which we perceive the world. Perhaps the link between thought to words is not one-directional, but rather a two way street.

### Political Theory
[Political Philosophy (MOC)](/mocs/political-philosophy-moc.md) deals with how societies act, collaborate, form identity and shape public perception. Topics like culture, economics, Post modernism, art usually fall into this category.
