#### Self Perception

we will make mistakes, it will be hard, but it will pass, better days will come.
You are not just a parent, you will still need hobbies and friends, you need to save time for that, this is what will provide you the power to go on.

make sure your emotional stability isn't dependent on the child, he is not supposed to be our care taker. If we become too dependent, it is a great weight for them to bear at such a young age, they lack the tools and resilience needed to hold themselves, let alone the parents. It will only bring stress.

### Misc.

We need to use emotional coaching with our kids. To show them that having emotions is okay, to **acknowledge their feelings**, and be more like a curious guide than a teacher. Help them reflect on the situation and not just tell them what to do, or to use punishment and rewards.

the kids need to know (explicitly and verbally), that when they are in need, no matter when, where, or which situation they are, we will come for them, no punishment, no judgment, we will always be there (perhaps find a safe-word for it)

baby waring:  
1. Not too much during the day (let them have free time to move and play)  
2. always facing you  
3. mouth is not covered, chin is upright (no obstacles for breathing)  
4. legs form an "m" shape (to protect the hip)
