# NLP (MOC)

## Notes

NLP or "natural language processing" is the method by which we "teach" a computer to read text. Since computers don't understand words, we have to convert text into numbers. The challenge is to convert it in such a way that "somehow" not only explains the meaning of the word, but perhaps only maintains it's role within a sentence, and the connection it has to the general meaning of it.

The best way to do that is through [TF-IDF](/notes/tf-idf.md), a method of converting text into a vector. The other is a [Naive Bayes classifier](/notes/naive-bayes-classifier.md) .

### Types of Analysis
With NLP, you can:
1. [Text Classification](/notes/text-classification.md) - For example to identify and categorize text as either "spam" or not spam
2. [Text Generation](/notes/text-generation.md) - The basis for all Chat AI models, that generate text based on a prompt
3. [Sources/References/Sentiment Analysis](/notes/sources/references/sentiment-analysis.md) - To analyze whether a text (perhaps a review) is either positive, negative, or neutral
4. [Topic Modeling](/notes/topic-modeling.md) - To group text by topic, for example news articles into political, economics, etc.

### Techniques
Most common features for NLP:
1. [Named Entity Recognition](/notes/named-entity-recognition.md) - To detect popular names such as companies within the text
2. [Regex](/notes/regex.md) - To search for matches within the text based on a special pattern. Also see [pattern matching](/notes/pattern-matching.md)
3. [Tokenization](/notes/tokenization.md) - To break town a sentence into base components (which can then be converted into a vector)
