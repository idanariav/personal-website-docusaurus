# Python (MOC)

## Notes

### Analysis focused python
i have done (or about to do several courses in python)
[Python + SQL + Tableau (course)](/notes/python-+-sql-+-tableau-course.md)
[Python for data science (course)](/notes/python-for-data-science-course.md) - this is the best course for [Data Science (MOC)](/mocs/data-science-moc.md) or [Data Analysis (MOC)](/mocs/data-analysis-moc.md), teaches useful packages such as NumPy, pandas, seaborn, etc...


### general usage python
also did a deep dive on python classes, since it is the backbone of OOP
[Python classes](/notes/python-classes.md)
[Complete python scripting for automation (course)](/notes/complete-python-scripting-for-automation-course.md) - gives a shallow completing information on working with files, systems and environments (things that data analysis courses don't cover)
[Automation with Python (course)](/notes/automation-with-python-course.md)
[How to read or write a file in Pyton](/notes/how-to-read-or-write-a-file-in-pyton.md)

#### theories / documentation
[Interpretation vs compilation](/notes/interpretation-vs-compilation.md) - how does python works under the hood

### Unsorted notes
```dataview
LIST FROM [Python (MOC)](/mocs/python-moc.md) AND -outgoing([Python (MOC)](/mocs/python-moc.md))
AND  !#Type/MOC AND !#review/Daily
sort file.name asc
```

### Visualization
[Plotly](/notes/plotly.md)
[Plot types - Matplotlib 3.5.1 documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index)
[Plotly Python Graphing Library](https://plotly.com/python/)
[Example gallery - seaborn 0.11.2 documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html)
