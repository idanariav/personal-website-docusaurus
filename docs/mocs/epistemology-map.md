# Epistemology (Map)

## Notes

Epistemology asks how do we know what we know. What is knowledge, and how is it different from a belief? can we ever be sure of something? What is [Truth](/notes/truth.md) ? As you can see, epistemology is highly affected by [Uncertainty](/notes/uncertainty.md) .

### Types of Knowledge
1. knowledge of others - aka [Theory of Mind](/notes/theory-of-mind.md) , we often fail to know what is going on on other's minds. We don't even know where consciousness lies ([the hard problem of consciousness](/notes/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness.md) )
2. [experience knowledge](/notes/experience-knowledge.md) - Some knowledge seems to be acquired only though an experience, even when the "technical" knowledge is out there from the beginning. See [Mary's room](/notes/marys-room.md) as an example.
3. [Social Construct](/notes/social-construct.md) - some things are "real" only because we collectively believe them to be true, like money.
4. [Subjective Reality](/notes/subjective-reality.md) - some things are "true" to us, our perception has the power to influence our own reality.
5. self knowledge - (aka [Self-awareness](/notes/self-awareness.md) ), to be aware of our mental and emotional states and the reasons for them. Sometimes it fails. Knowing ourselves can also explain why we [Desire](/notes/desire.md) certain things

### Types of Inquiry
There are several ways in which we asks ourselves how do we know something, or how we detect the "truth":
1. [Rationalism](/notes/rationalism.md) - Truth and reason are intertwined, by practicing logic relentlessly, we could discover truths about the world
2. [Empiricism](/notes/empiricism.md) - Reality is the best source of truth we have. Our minds are biased and limited, while through experimentation we could discover the truths of the world.
3. [Pragmatism](/notes/pragmatism.md) - what is "true" is what is "useful" to us, i.e "what works".
4. [contextualism](/notes/contextualism.md) - Truth depends on the situation and who is speaking. A statement can't be judged on it's own but only in a given context.
