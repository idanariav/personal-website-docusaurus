# Change

## Notes
The concept of change is both a technical and a philosophical one.
The relevant questions ranges from can we change who we are [Personal identity (Map)](/mocs/personal-identity-map.md), what we think, but also how do we bring change to ourselves, to our society.

change is hard (aka [Struggle](/notes/struggle.md) ), at the personal level and at the societal level. It requires us to let go of what we believed, who we are, the habits we adopted with them, and start something new. This is also dependent on which [Types of change](/notes/types-of-change.md) are we focusing on.

The [scientific method](/notes/scientific-method.md) is more open to those changes because it assumes in advance that all the knowledge we have is the best solution to our problems so far, but it might be found as false later on.

To make change a bit easier, we can [Start Small](/notes/start-small.md) , and remember that changing ourselves, even if it means that some parts have to be discarded only makes us better, more beautiful ([kintsugi](/notes/kintsugi.md) ). Some changes don't require us to start something new, but rather just stop doing what we're already doing, by knowing [When to Quit](/notes/when-to-quit.md).
