# Wellbeing (MOC)

## Notes

What is the state of wellbeing, how one defines happiness and how one brings it? These are the questions related to our wellbeing. While it seems obvious what it is and isn't, those questions haunt us from the early days of Greek philosophy, of how to live well and how morality relates to wellbeing. The unfortunate truth is that most of us don't know what will truly make us happy ([Happiness is contentment](/notes/happiness-is-contentment.md) )

A common related concept is [Maslows pyramid](/notes/maslows-pyramid.md), that shows which needs have to be fulfilled in order to achieve happiness.

### Contributors to wellbeing
1. [Addition by subtraction](/notes/addition-by-subtraction.md) - If we only add more and more obligations to our lives, it will only become more difficult to maintain. By wanting and doing less, we could find happiness
2. [Altruism](/notes/giving.md) - To help others, to bring happiness to others cultivates it also within us
3. [Boundaries](/notes/boundaries.md) - To reduce the negative effect of expectations and miscommunication, we should set clear boundaries in our relationships with others. 
4. . [Happiness is an internal state](/notes/happiness-is-an-internal-state.md) - To understand that happiness is not dependent on external circumstances, "if x than I will be happy" is a false and misleading statement. Happiness comes from within. Usually we have such epiphany after experiencing hardships.
5. [Nature walk](/notes/nature-walk.md) - Our connection to nature is a strong, primal one. To become one with nature is a strong contributor to happiness. 
6. [Self-compassion](/notes/self-compassion.md) - Without being kind to ourselves, we could not be happy
7. [Solitude](/notes/solitude.md) - To be with oneself, to explore our rich inner world
8. [Relationships](/notes/relationships.md) - a deep connection with others
9. [Agency](/notes/agency.md) - having a sense of control over yourself and your environment 
10. [Existentialism (MOC)](/mocs/existentialism-moc.md) - having a sense of purpose in life
11. [Happiness is to be virtuous](/notes/happiness-is-to-be-virtuous.md) - when we align between our values and our behavior, which leads to happiness
12. [Happiness is shared](/notes/happiness-is-shared.md) - when we find pleasure in sharing our happiness with others, and sharing in their happiness as well
13. [Gratitude](/notes/gratitude.md) - when we appreciate the good in our live
14. [Meditation](/notes/meditation.md) - when we find time to clear our mind, and focus on the present
15. [Inclusion](/notes/inclusion.md) - when we feel that we belong

### Obstacles to wellbeing
1. [Akrasia](/notes/akrasia.md) - when we let distractions and temptations overrule our better judgment. 
2. [Perfect is the enemy of good](/notes/perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good.md) - when unrealistic expectations stop us from acting the way we want to
3. [Expectations](/notes/expectations.md) - when we depend our happiness on the external world, specifically on the future, which only shatters it once it doesn't come to pass. 
4. [Hedonic Treadmill](/notes/hedonic-treadmill.md) - what we think will bring us happiness only reverts us back to the same level
5. [Comparisons](/notes/comparisons.md) - when we compare ourselves to others instead of seeing how much better we got compared to our past self
6. [Negative cycle](/notes/negative-cycle.md) - when bad behavior or thought leads to another in a vicious cycle
