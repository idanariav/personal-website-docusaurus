# Mindset (MOC)

## Notes

### Motivation Restoring
How can we feel energized, motivated and approach life with a positive attitude?
1. [Small Wins](/notes/small-wins.md) - take a second to enjoy how far you've come, and celebrate even the smallest of wins
2. [Self affirmation](/notes/self-affirmation.md) - remind yourself that you have worth, and be kind to yourself
3. [job crafting](/notes/job-crafting.md) - create meaning in what you do, see it through a perspective of helping others
4. [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) - your skills can grow with time
5. [Optimism](/notes/optimism.md) - it is up to us to decide how to view reality, and whether we would be able to thrive in it

### Counter Negative Cycle
How can we rise up after we fall?
1. we need to take a new perspective on [Rejection](/notes/rejection.md)
2. [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md) - things might feel bad now, but if we zoom out we might see things in a clearer, healthier perspective
3. [The law of reverse effect](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md) - sometimes, the more we try, the more we push things away, perhaps it is better to let things go
4. [forward thinking](/notes/forward-thinking.md) - To think about the future in advance, and preparing for it today

### Productivity Mindset
How can we remain focused and dedicated in what we do?
1. [Fleetingness](/notes/fleetingness.md) - what we experience now is unique, so we should pay attention to it
2. [Love what is good](/notes/love-what-is-good.md) - we need to adjust our preferences such that we will love, enjoy doing the things that are good for us and others
3. [Optimization](/notes/optimization.md) - To constantly try to improve something, to make it efficient

### Healthy Thinking
How can make sure our thinking is clear and positive?
4. [Filtering](/notes/filtering.md) - To take in only the information we need to receive, blocking noise
5. [scientific method](/notes/scientific-method.md) - To hold ideas softly, as theories to test and not identities that define us
6. [positive language](/notes/positive-language.md) - To use empowering, enabling language that allows for growth instead of limiting, negative language

### No Thinking
Perhaps a healthy mindset is no mindset at all?
1. [Wu wei](/notes/wu-wei.md) - A state of being, of not resisting, of connecting instead of forcing your thinking onto the world

### Unhealthy Thinking
1. [manifesting](/notes/manifesting.md) - When we try to bend reality to our perspective, as if it obeys us, instead of seeing it as it is
2. [Pessimism](/notes/pessimism.md) - To view life through a black colored lens, to mistrust and have no faith or hope in others or that things will be better
