# Mindset (MOC)

## Notes

### Motivation restoring
How can we feel energized, motivated and approach life with a positive attitude?
1. [Small Wins](/notes/small-wins.md) - take a second to enjoy how far you've come, and celebrate even the smallest of wins
2. [Self affirmation](/notes/self-affirmation.md) - remind yourself that you have worth, and be kind to yourself
3. [job crafting](/notes/job-crafting.md) - create meaning in what you do, see it through a perspective of helping others
4. [Growth Mindset](/notes/growth-mindset.md) - your skills can grow with time
5. [Optimism](/notes/optimism.md) - it is up to us to decide how to view reality, and whether we would be able to thrive in it


### counter negative cycle
How can we rise up after we fall?
1. we need to take a new perspective on [Rejection](/notes/rejection.md)
2. [Zoom out](/notes/zoom-out.md) - things might feel bad now, but if we zoom out we might see things in a clearer, healthier perspective
3. [The law of reverse effect](/notes/the-law-of-reverse-effect.md) - sometimes, the more we try, the more we push things away, perhaps it is better to let things go

### productivity mindset
How can we remain focused and dedicated in what we do?
1. [Fleetingness](/notes/fleetingness.md) - what we experience now is unique, so we should pay attention to it
2. [Love what is good](/notes/love-what-is-good.md) - we need to adjust our preferences such that we will love, enjoy doing the things that are good for us and others
