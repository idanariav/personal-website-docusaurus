# Epistemology (MOC)

## Notes

Epistemology asks how do we know what we know. What is knowledge, and how is it different from a belief? can we ever be sure of something? What is [[Truth]] ? As you can see, epistemology is highly affected by [[Uncertainty]] .

### Types of Knowledge
1. knowledge of others - aka [[Theory of Mind]] , we often fail to know what is going on on other's minds. We don't even know where consciousness lies ([[the hard problem of consciousness]] )
2. [[experience knowledge]] - Some knowledge seems to be acquired only though an experience, even when the "technical" knowledge is out there from the beginning. See [[Mary's room]] as an example.
3. [[Social Construct]] - some things are "real" only because we collectively believe them to be true, like money.
4. [[Subjective Reality]] - some things are "true" to us, our perception has the power to influence our own reality.
5. self knowledge - (aka [[Self-awareness]] ), to be aware of our mental and emotional states and the reasons for them. Sometimes it fails. Knowing ourselves can also explain why we [[Desire]] certain things

### Types of Inquiry
There are several ways in which we asks ourselves how do we know something, or how we detect the "truth":
1. [[Rationalism]] - Truth and reason are intertwined, by practicing logic relentlessly, we could discover truths about the world
2. [[Empiricism]] - Reality is the best source of truth we have. Our minds are biased and limited, while through experimentation we could discover the truths of the world.
3. [[Pragmatism]] - what is "true" is what is "useful" to us, i.e "what works".
4. [[contextualism]] - Truth depends on the situation and who is speaking. A statement can't be judged on it's own but only in a given context.
